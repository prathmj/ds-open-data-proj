Elicia Feasel,  Executive Director of the Historic Preservation Commission with offices at 125 S. 
Lafayette, served as the presenter and petitioner of this bill. The owners of this property, known
as the Elbel House, have petitioned the Historic Preservation Commission to have this property
designated as a historic landmark. Elbel House is located in the Chapin Park Local Historic
District and Chapin Park National Register Historic District and is recognized in the Indiana
Historic Sites and Structures inventory with a rating of "contributing ". Ms. Feasel stated she
believes that rating will be elevated in the next survey. Based on the local landmarks criteria as
adopted by the Common Council, the site can be recommend for designation as a historic
landmark. The site fulfills all three ( 3)  criteria. It is an excellent example of Queen Ann
Victorian Architecture. Built in 1894,  it exemplifies the architectural, style through extensive
exterior decoration. The original construction is still completely intact on the exterior. Richard
Elbel was the director of the South Bend Orchestra. Mr. Elbel also served on the Parks
Commission being the only charter member to serve continuously until his retirement in 1939. In
1963 the Elbel Golf Course was named in his honor. The Historic Preservation Commission has
reviewed the petition and report by the staff and has conducted public hearing where the current
and former owner has spoken in favor with no one speaking in opposition. Adopted on August
15th 2016,  Resolution 16 -02 resolves that the Elbel House is recommended to the Common
Council for establishment as an historic landmark. 

There were no questions from the Council. 

Those from the public wishing to speak in favor: 

Joan Downs - Krostenko,  849 Forest Ave. South Bend IN, stated she is the previous owner of the
house.  She is the person who restored the house and it was in very poor condition when she
acquired the house. It is an important anchor on the west side of the Chapin Park neighborhood. 
The new owners are a delightful family who could not be here because they are giving birth to
their second child but they are also very much in favor of the bill. 

There was no one wishing to speak in opposition. 

Councilmember Tim Scott stated this house is in his district. Unfortunately this beautiful gem
was in really bad shape due to a poor owner and it is through the hard work of Ms. Downs - 
Krostenko who turned this back into a beautiful home. 

Councilmember Tim Scott made a motion to send Bill 43 -16 to the full Council with a favorable
recommendation. Councilmember Dr. Varner seconded the motion which carried by a voice vote

RESOLUTIONS

A RESOLUTION OF THE COMMON COUNCIL
OF THE CITY OF SOUTH BEND, INDIANA IN
SUPPORT OF A REASONABLE TRANSITION
TO CLEAN ENERGY FOR SOUTH BEND

Councilmember Karen White made a motion to accept Substitute Bill 16 -57.  Councilmember
Gavin Ferlic seconded the motion which carried by a voice vote of nine ( 9)  ayes. 

Councilmember Dr. David Varner, Chair of the Utilities Committee, reported that they met and
send this forward with a favorable recommendation. 

Councilmember Dr. David Varner and Councilmember Oliver Davis served as the petitioners of
this bill. 

Councilmember Dr. Varner stated several months ago the Sierra Club came to the City of South
Bend and asked the Council to look into a resolution in support of clean energy. To that end the
Utilities Committee held a public meeting in the middle of August where members from the
Sierra Club and Indiana Michigan Power met to exchange ideas and thoughts. With the help of
our Director of Sustainability, Therese Dorau, we put together a resolution that represents the
interest group. 
entirety of the City of South Bend without delving too far to the side of one ( 1) 

Councilmember Oliver Davis stated he was glad to work along with Councilmember Dr. Varner
on this important issue and thanked the co- sponsors Councilmembers Ferlic and Scott as well. 
This resolution specifically makes note of "cleaner"  energy because we are always working
towards cleaner solutions. This resolution is broken down into two (2)  different parts.  The first
part is the section where we focus on what our goals are in South Bend in the interest of cleaner
sources of energy. The second part contains an exhibits section. This is a culmination of the
different issues we have heard from I &M and the Sierra Club. We mentioned moving away from
coal as an energy source but we recognize it will not happen overnight. The Council encourages
I &M look at the eleven ( 11)  recommendations as stated in the exhibitions section. We will send
this resolution, if it is passed, to our state representatives down in Indianapolis after the
upcoming election. Councilmember Davis invited Ms. Dorau to speak to the Council. 

Therese Dorau, Director of Sustainability for South Bend with offices on the 13th Floor of the
County -City Building, stated that the Sierra Club and I &M are partners of their office helping to
educate her staff on energy issues.  She expressed her gratitude in being able to educate the
Council on energy issues and this resolution represents a good deal of compromise but also a
good amount of seeking increased understanding and information. This is a good baseline for our
community of have intelligent and well informed conversations about energy in the future. 

Councilmember Davis stated it is important for our representatives down in Indianapolis to know
that we did this in a bi- partisan fashion. That is one ( 1)  of the reasons this is such a solid start
because everyone is on board. 

Councilmember Dr. Varner stated a great experience of being on the Council is that you find
yourself involved in situations or discussions which force you to go and seek information. In this
case it is clean energy. Councilmember Dr. Varner stated he has never ceased to be amazed at
how much information is out there and how accessible it is today. The partners we worked with
on this resolution were willing to share that information and have that conversation which
allowed us to put together something that hopefully will receive unanimous support. 

There were no questions from Council. 

Those from the public wishing to speak in favor of the bill: 

Steve Francis,  54174 Juday Lake Dr. South Bend IN, stated he is a state board member of the
Sierra Club. He thanked Councilmembers Davis and Dr. Varner for leading this effort and
galvanizing the interest of the public. It is not often Indiana Michigan Power and the Sierra Club
can be on the same side. We did not get everything we wanted in this resolution but it is
something we are very happy to support. There is already a good start for clean energy in South
Bend with the sustainability office and all the great energy projects they have been announcing

of late.  I &M is also to be commended for the expansion of their solar panel fields. It is a good
start but unfortunately as of now it is not enough. We originally wanted to have this resolution
call for the closure of the Rockport Coal Plant. It was a democratic process and we didn' t get
that, but it does need to be closed. Rockport provides almost half of the power for the I &M
territory and faces incredibly high costs to keep it open and clean up the plant. It is the second
largest polluter in Indiana in terms of carbon emissions and the sixth largest polluter nationwide
of toxic pollutants. Mr. Francis expressed particular support for the " exhibit" portion of the
resolution which illustrates things that the City can explore in moving us to become a cleaner
city. 

Christopher Cobb,  215 E. Pokagon Street South Bend, expressed thanks to the Utilities
Committee for their hard work on this resolution. This is a great document and it is great to see
the Council taking seriously the need for forward thinking policy. The work on this resolution
made a solid document that addresses not only issues of power generation but also social justice
and the cost of energy. It is an extremely well- designed resolution and South Bend is
demonstrating leadership in our state. This is the kind of City we can all be proud to call home. 
This comes at a wonderful time to make sure I &M, our public utility, stays accountable to the
public it serves. 

Dr. Phil Sakimoto, professor at the University of Notre Dame in sustainability and astrophysics, 
stated prior to working at Notre Dame he worked at NASA where he was the manager of their
public outreach program. It has been his job for many years to interpret current research for the
public. He stated the recent tremendous floods that South Bend received were not a natural
disaster. Those floods were an unnatural disaster caused by the fact that we continue to use fossil
fuels and cause our planet to get warmer. Warmer air holds more moisture so when the rains
come there is more to dump on us.  As our globe warms, it is not uniform. The artic regions are
warming at twice the rate of the equatorial regions. The difference in temperature between the
equator and North Pole has lessened and the jet stream is getting weaker. In the old days, the jet
stream would have pushed that storm on in a few hours but it is now too weak to do that. That is
why the storm lingered for so long and that is why we had flooding. With our warming climate
we can only expect more of that. We need to stop putting more carbon in the air. He commended
the Council for this resolution. For every ten ( 10)  years we delay carbon reduction measures the
peak temperature will be half a degree centigrade higher. This is a great start but it' s not enough. 
We have to take bigger actions and hopefully this resolution is the beginning of moving our
community towards zero ( 0)  carbon emissions.  We need to do this for our children so they have a
livable planet. 

Carolyn Haas,  606 North Saint Peter Street South Bend IN, stated she is a student at the
University of Notre Dame and is speaking on behalf of hundreds of ND students and also Fossil
Free Notre Dame which is a campaign urging ND to divest its endowment to remove itself from
fossil fuels consumption. She stated she is so pleased to attend a university with such a
supportive community in regards to sustainability measures.  The office of sustainability at Notre
Dame has failed the community. It is wonderful to see South Bend respecting the voices of the
community while Notre Dame has not. 

Meghan Anderson,  1100 West 42nd Street Indianapolis, stated she is a conservation activist with
the Sierra Club and is thankful to see such leadership coming from South Bend. This is a strong
signal to our utilities to move away from coal and develop cleaner energy. We know it is cheaper
to retire coal in the long term. Ms. Anderson stated she will share this resolution in Fort Wayne
and Muncie where she also works. The more renewable energy we have in the area I &M serves, 
the more jobs for local people. 

No one from the public spoke against the resolution. 

Councilmember Randy Kelly commended Councilmembers Dr. Varner and Davis for taking this
issue on. Anytime we get two (2)  disparate groups to come together, we are doing an admirable
thing. This is a wonderful first step and it is time for bold moves forward. South Bend can be a
leader in this work. 

Councilmember Broden stated she echoed Councilmember Kelly' s opinion.

Davis put into this and bringing all sides together. Two (2)  different entities that disagree coming

Councilmember Oliver Davis, Chair of the Zoning and Annexation Committee, reported that
they met and send this forward with a favorable recommendation. 

Ayoka Paek, Building Department with offices at 125 Lafayette Blvd. South Bend, served as the
presenter of this bill. This is an application for a cell tower at 3001 Cleveland Avenue. The Area
Board of Zoning Appeals sends this with a favorable recommendation and there were no
variances applied for with this application. The petitioner is intending to meet all the
requirements for cell towers. There was no remonstrance at the meeting and one ( 1)  person came
to the Building Department prior to the meeting to ask questions about the application and they
left content. 

Brian Donnelly, 660 Midwest Road Oakbrook Terrace Illinois, served as the petitioner for this
bill. The residents of St. Joseph County have asked Verizon for improved quality of cell
coverage. This new tower will help with that request. Currently at peak hours, residents of the
county have issues with connectivity issues and this is the only way to relieve that and improve
quality of coverage. 

There were no questions from Council. 

No one from the public spoke either in favor of or in opposition to the bill.

their current location but are landlocked and have exceeded the ability to expand anymore. This
