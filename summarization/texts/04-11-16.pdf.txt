REGULAR MEETING

APRIL 11,  2015

Council President Tim Scott reported that the IT Committee met and sends this bill to the full
Council with a favorable recommendation. 

Council President Tim Scott served as the presenter and petitioner of this bill. He stated they are
asking to repeal the Facebook and Social Media standards in light of the new council and
regarding any litigation so they wish to remove the standards. 

There were no questions from the Council. 

No one from the public spoke in favor of the bill. 

One member of the public spoke in opposition to the bill: 

Rhonda Richards,  1020 Clover St.  South Bend IN, thanked Councilmembers Tim Scott,  Gavin
Ferlic and former Councilmember Derek Dieter for taking time to listen to her and her concerns
about inappropriate social media uses in the past by councilmembers.  She understands the legal
challenges against the standards brought by the ACLU on Councilmember Oliver Davis'  behalf. 
She claims the ACLU had given their ok when the bill was being written and discussed initially. 
For them to turn around and sue against it seems like profiteering and a possible conflict of
interest on their part. Also, she stated her concern toward the president of the Council for
allowing one member to hold the Council and City hostage with a frivolous lawsuit because he is
apparently double minded on this issue. During the debates and conversations about Municipal
Code 2 -9. 1,  Oliver Davis blustered on and on that he wanted everyone to know that he was the
first to request this type of clarity several years before and nothing was ever done.  So now
instead of being an asset to the City and Council he is throwing an adult temper tantrum because
he didn' t get his own way. It' s not exactly what he wanted so he' ll hold his breath till he turns
blue, costing the City and the Council valuable time and effort that they and he have been elected
to spend representing the citizens of South Bend. The additional fact that one of our new
Councilmembers, John Voorde, has already admitted to using government owned computers to
be on the Ashley Madison website seems to be yet another reason why a code such as Municipal
Code 2 -9. 1 is needed, not a reason to repeal it. She thanked Tim Scott and Gavin Ferlic again for
hearing her initial concerns and their actions but she is disappointed with the back room deals
and apparent lack of strength in this Council and administration to stand up for what is right. She
submitted her comments to the Clerk' s Office for public record. 

Councilmember Karen White made a motion to send Bill 18 -16 to the full Council with a
favorable recommendation.  Councilmember John Voorde seconded the motion which carried by
a voice vote of eight ( 8)  ayes.

THE COMMON COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF
SOUTH BEND, INDIANA, TO ADDRESS

BUSKERS AND SIDEWALK PERFORMERS BY

MUNICIPAL CODE, RE- CODIFYING AND

AMENDING IT WITHIN A NEW ARTICLE 13

THROUGH 14 -126 OF THE MUNICIPAL CODE, 

AND FURTHER AMENDING CHAPTER 13, 

ARTICLE 12,  SECTION 13 -26 CONCERNING

SOLICITATIONS

Councilmember John Voorde reported the Health and Public Safety Committee met and sends
this bill forward with a favorable recommendation. 

Aladean DeRose,  City Attorney with offices on the 12a' Floor of the County -City Building, 
served as the presenter and petitioner of this bill. The objective of this bill is threefold. First, to
pass an unquestionably constitutional ordinance.  Second, to provide reasonable time, place and
manor restrictions on street performers otherwise known as buskers. Third, to welcome and

4

REGULAR MEETING

APRIL 11,  2015

encourage busking activities within the downtown South Bend area. This ordinance would
amend the current busker ordinance on file that was passed back in December of 2013 which has
been challenged by the ACLU on behalf of a busker in South Bend. By later Council action the
ordinance was suspended in terms of enforcement and the challenge was to find out how buskers
were faring in South Bend and whether to continue with the current ordinance. As a result the
administration interviewed members of the business community and downtown South Bend
parties and the overwhelming response was that busking is a good thing for the city. Therefore
the City wants to continue the process but do so in a constitutional manor. Therfore the changes
proposed include the recodification of the ordinance,  eliminating the fee requirement and the
licensing process and moving the ordinance to the regulatory section of the South Bend
Municipal Code. Also it has been amended to change the distance requirements and has them as
recommendations not mandates.  The fine has been reduced from $250 to $ 200 for the second
offense. A busker has a duty to provide self - identification information if requested by an officer
who suspects the busker has not complied with the ordinance. There is also an exemption in the
solicitation ordinance to permit buskers to solicit fees if they do so in a non - aggressive manor. 
With these changes,  the Administration believes all parties will be satisfied with this ordinance. 

Council Vice President Oliver Davis asked if the person in the lawsuit is aware and approves of

the changes. 

Council. Attorney DeRose responded yes. 

No one from the public spoke in favor or opposition to the bill. 

Councilmember John Voorde made a motion to send Bill 19 -16 to the full Council with a
favorable recommendation.  Councilmember Karen White seconded the motion which carried by
a voice vote of eight ( 8)  ayes.

Councilmember Karen White reported that Personnel and Finance Committee met and send this
bill forward with a favorable recommendation. 

John Murphy, City Controller with offices on the 12th Floor of the County City Building, served
as the presenter and petitioner of the bill. It has been the practice of the Common Council to
amend the budget quarterly which has worked pretty well. This bill is regarding the Enterprise
Funds which are the business type funds of the city. The first expense is moving that money to a
new fund the Council created in January. The second is purchasing a new ambulance and cardiac
monitors. The third is for accounting and budgeting assistance. The fourth is for bond issuance
cost, the majority occurred last year but one invoice did not come in on time and so it was paid
this year. The next is from a fund created from the contract by SMG and we are spending the
remaining balance of that account for capital improvements. 

There were no questions from Council and no comments from the public. 

Councilmember Tim Scott made a motion to send Bill 15 -16 to the full Council with a favorable
recommendation. Councilmember Dr. David Varner seconded the motion which carried by a
voice vote of eight ( 8)  ayes.

29,300 FROM COUNTY OPTION INCOME TAX

FUND ( #404). 

Councilmember Karen White reported that the Personnel and Finance Committee met and sends
this bill forward with a favorable recommendation. 

John Murphy, City Controller with offices on the 12th Floor of the County City Building, served
as the presenter and petitioner of the bill. The civil city funds are the property tax supported
funds. The first appropriation is out of the Fire Dept. budget for temporary budget assistance. 
The second is out of the state grant fund, this is an expenditure which was thought to occur last
year but it did not. It is fully refundable through the blight elimination federal program so the
City will get the money back so there is no net cost. The third is a transfer from the enterprise
fund appropriation and putting it into this unsafe building fund that the Council created in
January. In a sense it is a transfer but for accounting purposes it' s a reduction of an appropriation
and an increase of an appropriation. The fourth is for copier equipment. The final one is for job
training costs that were awarded last year, the City did not encumber the money so the budget
did not carry over from last year so the money needs to be appropriated again. 

Council Vice President Oliver Davis asked if there was a reason the money was not encumbered. 

Mr. Murphy responded it was just a mistake. 

No one from the public spoke in support or opposition to the bill. 

REGULAR MEETING

APRIL 11,  2015

Councilmember Tim Scott made a motion to send Bill 17 -16 to the full Council with a favorable

PUBLIC HEARING ON AN ORDINANCE OF THE
COMMON COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SOUTH BEND, 
INDIANA, FOR BUDGET TRANSFERS FOR VARIOUS
DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE CITY OF SOUTH
BEND,  INDIANA FOR THE YEAR 2016

Councilmember Karen White reported that Personnel and Finance Committee met and sends this

bill forward with a favorable recommendation. 

John Murphy, City Controller with offices on the 12th Floor of the County City Building, served
as the presenter and petitioner of the bill. This last bill is a budget transfer, not additional
appropriations,  from one department to another department or one account to another account
within the same fund. The first is a transfer in the Parks Dept. from a supply account to a capital
account for the purchase of two (2)  concession trailers. The second is transfers for some office
furniture and the third is a cleanup of some payments that were in the wrong account that were
not fixed in the 2016 budget. 

There were no questions from the Council and no one from the public spoke in favor or
opposition to the bill. 

Councilmember Tim Scott made a motion to send bill 16 -16 to the full Council with a favorable
recommendation.  Councilmember Karen White seconded the motion which carried by a voice
vote of eight ( 8)  ayes.

A RESOLUTION OF THE COMMON COUNCIL OF

THE CITY OF SOUTH BEND, INDIANA, APPROVING

AN AGREEMENT WITH THE POKAGON BAND OF

POTAWATOMI INDIANS

Councilmember Karen White reported that the Personnel and Finance Committee met and send
this bill forward with a favorable recommendation. 

Mayor Pete Buttigieg, offices on the 10 Floor of the County -City Building, served as the
presenter of this bill. He stated Cristal Brisco,  Corporation Counsel,  will make the presentation
but he wished to provide some context first. The goal of this resolution is to ask the Council to
express support for the terms of a local agreement the City has negotiated with the Pokagon
Band. Under this agreement the City, along with a number of local causes,  will benefit
financially from revenue at a proposed gaming facility on Tribal land within the City limits. The
Mayor wished to clear up some inconsistencies about the authorities that do and do not exist in
this case.  A number of constituents have reached out to the Mayor' s Office both in support and
opposition to the proposed facility. The City has no authority to regulate gaming on Tribal
Sovereign Land. This Administration and this Council are not in a position either to allow or to
prevent this type of gaming on federally recognized Tribal Land. Even though the land would
technically be within the City limits, once the land in trust is approved by the Department of the
Interior it is effectively not governed like the rest of the City and the land for these purposes is
considered sovereign. This is the way that American law treats Tribal Land as a matter of regard
for the original citizens of the land that eventually became the United States. 

Gaming of Tribal Land can go forward with or without any involvement, approval or disapproval
from the City. Even if this agreement is voted down, gaming could go forward on this site once it
is federally recognized. The question then is whether the Council supports the Administration' s
efforts to obtain substantial benefits to the City from the planned facility. 

When the idea of tribal gaming first was discussed, the Mayor indicated the Administration
could be supportive if and only if the benefits to the community outweighed the costs.  This
agreement is a framework to make sure that is the case.  For many years the Pokagon Band has
been a very active and constructive community partner in both visible and quiet ways. There
have been high profile sponsorships like Four Winds Field and the Tribe' s substantial
sponsorship of the SB 150 celebrations. There have also been a number of unadvertised charitable
contributions throughout the community. As this gaming facility became more of a possibility, 
the Tribe communicated to the Administration that they wanted to maintain a positive
relationship with the community even while retaining their sovereign rights under American law. 

12

REGULAR MEETING

APRIL 11,  2015

It is in keeping with that framework that the Administration negotiated an agreement is
unprecedented in its generosity to a community with Class Two tribal gaming. Any gaming
facility brings costs as well as benefits, those costs can include increased use of infrastructure, 
public safety resources and potential economic effects that can cut both ways. The purpose of
this agreement is to ensure the benefits outweigh the costs. Under the agreement, the City
receives two percent ( 2 %)  net revenue with a guaranteed floor of either $ 1 million or $2 million
dollars a year depending on the size of the facility. The Administration believes the actual
revenues are going to be much higher than that minimum. The funding can be used for public
safety, economic development or other appropriate uses as budgeted by the Administration and
Council in the years to come. In addition, the Tribe has agreed to donate $ 5 million dollars over
five (5)  years to a number of important causes in the community that range from the Bowman
Creek Project, Boys and Girls Club,  South Bend School Corporation, the local Food Bank, Parks
Department, landscaping and resurfacing on Prairie Ave and a number of other projects. These
commitments have come from a vigorous back and forth discussion between the Administration
and the Tribe. Collectively, this agreement meets the best interest of both the City and the Tribe. 
There is a lot of passion in the community both in favor and in opposition to Indian gaming but
the Mayor wished to stress that the question of whether gaming will happen or not has already
been decided by Federal Law. The question now is do we play a role in how the City can benefit
from that casino.  The full text is online for public inspection as well. 

Cristal Brisco, Corporation Counsel of the City with offices on the 12th Floor of the County -City
Building, spoke about the legal specifics of the agreement.  This agreement deals with the
proposed development of the 166 acre site in South Bend which includes a tribal village and a

casino.  This demonstrates the Pokagon' s good faith efforts to replace lost tax revenue as a result
of this property becoming Federal Trust land. There is no legal requirement for the Tribe to offer
Class 2 gaming agreement with the City. This agreement involves payments in lieu of taxes, $ 5
million in community donations and other terms and conditions related to the development of the
site. The Pokagon Band agreed to make an annual payment to the City of South Bend which is
equal to two percent ( 2 %)  of net wins. The net wins calculation is comprised of the total amount
wagered minus the total amount paid for prizes on each game, excluding free play. One percent
1 %)  will be paid to the City' s general fund and the other one percent ( 1 %)  will be paid to the
South Bend Redevelopment Commission to fund initiatives broadly aimed at contributing to the
improvement of local educational opportunities and to address poverty and unemployment in the
City. The first payment will be due one ( 1)  year after the casino is open for gaming. The
payments will not be less than $ 1 million annually if the casino is home to between 850 and 1699
games and will not be less than $2 million annually if the casino is home to over 1700 games. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis asked the Mayor how he would respond to the claims that crime
would increase, more negative outsiders would come to the City and that traffic will be
congested on the South West side of the City. 

Mayor Buttigieg responded they have made no effort to ignore the fact that there are costs as
well as benefits and that is exactly why it is so important we have this agreement. The Tribe was
willing to enter into good faith discussions with us on how to ensure with community that this
will be a net positive for South Bend. For example certainly there will be more traffic on the
roads which leads to more wear and tear but that would be offset by resurfacing improvements to
Prairie Ave as well as the extra money in the General Fund. The revenue promised more than
exceeds any costs we would expect for any additional burden on safety resources. There is a very
strong case that this will be an economic development generator for the City. It is understandable
to have a fear of the unknown as this is something the City has never had before but the level of
support the Tribe is willing to commit toward it is extraordinary. The Federal approval process is
its own entity outside of the scope of this agreement and there is opportunity for public input on
that end. This is an opportunity for us to say the community will benefit the most from this
proposed project. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis asked the Mayor to speculate on how five (5)  to ten ( 10)  years
from now this project would leave a positive mark on the City of South Bend with this
agreement in place. 

13

REGULAR MEETING

APRIL 11,  2015

Mayor Buttigieg said he thinks of this agreement as a way to take the next step in our
community' s relationship with its first citizens. The Pokagon Band has been here since before
the City of South Bend was incorporated and that relationship has gone through many stages. 
Five (5)  to ten ( 10)  years from now, we will be able to point not only to the impact of any jobs
and physical growth that is accrued to the tribal citizens, which many are also our residents as
well in South Bend, but also we will be able to look at the effects of the improvement
contemplated in the agreement from the charitable contributions and also that extra revenue for
the City. 

Councilmember Randy Kelly asked the Mayor if during the course of the negotiations if there
was any talk of the casino being potentially a smoke free area. 

Mayor Buttigieg stated they clearly shared their interest in that outcome but because it is
sovereign land we are not in a position to request that. The Four Winds facility in Michigan has
smoke free bars and restaurants however no conclusion was reached to constrain them in South

Bend. 

Councilmember Regina Williams- Preston thanked Cristal Brisco and James Mueller for
clarifying and answering some of the Council questions on the agreement and those answers
were very informative. She stated as far as she knew at those other Four Winds facilities the bars
and restaurants were smoke free but not on the floor of the casino so it is not completely smoke
free. 

Mayor Buttigieg stated he did not have detailed knowledge but yes that was his understanding as

well. 

Councilmember Regina Williams- Preston asked Corporation Counsel Brisco to clarify if the
Administration has a sense of how many games are currently planning to come to the casino so
the Council knows if the City can expect to get that $2 million floor or $1 million floor. 

Corporation Counsel Brisco responded they do have a sense and believe it will be more than the
1700 games so the $2 million floor would be in effect. 

Councilmember Williams- Preston asked about why the gift to Howard Park was significantly
higher than the other community gifts. 

Corporation Counsel Brsico responded the donations of $5 million over five (5)  years is just
another example of the Tribe' s generosity and when they came with those suggestions, the
Administration welcomed them.  It is $2. 25 million dedicated to Howard Park, which is a Park
that is centrally located in the City and is used by a diverse set of residents. 

Council President Scott asked Corporation Counsel Brisco to address any services that the Tribe
does provide for people with gambling addictions and also thanked Corporation Counsel Cristal
Brisco and the Mayor' s Chief of Staff James Mueller for being prompt and eager to work with
and answer the Council' s questions on this issue. 

Corporation Counsel Brisco thanked Council President Scott for bringing up the gambling
addiction issue and she does have packets for the Council regarding the different services the
Tribe provides for people with addictions. They recently made a contribution of $25, 000 this
year to gambling addiction services and that is an ongoing annual contribution. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis asked to clarify when the payments would be received by the City
and how that process would work. 

Corporation Counsel Brisco responded the payments would be received annually starting one
year after the casino opened. 

Those from the public wishing to speak in favor of the bill: 

Jason Banicki Critchlow, 3822 W. Ford St.  South Bend IN, spoke in favor of the agreement.  It
gives the City a large amount of funds which are definitely needed. People are going to go to the
casinos no matter where they are, people need their vices, and it' s great that one finally may
come here.  It' s a shame this is not the first casino the Pokagon' s built in the area but at least it is
finally getting done.  We have seen in New Buffalo how they have been good community

14

REGULAR MEETING

APRIL 11,  2015

partners and done their due diligence wherever they go. This will provide a lot ofjobs for a
demographic that doesn' t have many options for good paying jobs and that' s the undereducated
workers. Those workers can earn economic incentives. This is a twenty -one (21)  and over
facility and people are adults and can choose to go there. We can see the benefits that these
casinos have brought cities like New Buffalo. South Bend is turning around a lot of negative
years in this city and we are starting to improve everywhere and this is an opportunity to give
people a chance to see how much South Bend has changed and grown over the years.  The
redevelopment money gives many great possibilities, maybe even with the zoo, to do some great
things. 

Jesse Davis,  P. O.  Box 10205 South Bend IN, stated Mr. Banicki Cricthlow covered the positives
of this deal pretty well. People are adults and they are going to gamble wherever the casino is so
it' s not smart to try to fight it. The amount ofjobs this project would create and the amount of
money the City is receiving is something that is defiantly a positive for the area. 

Thomas Clempe,  1122 N. Ironwood South Bend IN, stated he thinks this is a good idea. The
Pokagon Tribe are going to build this regardless so we might as well work with them but he did
express disappointment that city officials have disregarded local bars by banning smoking for
those bars and push those smokers to the casino to boost city revenue but he is in favor of this

agreement. 

Those wishing to speak against the bill: 

Jake Tesca,  19489 Green Acre St.  South Bend IN, represents a group called Citizens for a Better
Michiana. He stated the idea that this casino is going to come no matter what so the City should
get a cut of the pie is a foolish argument. It would be like saying there are heroin users all over
the City and they are going to do it no matter what so we should try to get a cut of that money
too.  Studies have shown living within ten ( 10)  miles of a casino doubles a person' s chances of
becoming a gambling addict and up to fifty percent ( 50 %) of gambling revenue for casinos
comes from gambling addicts. The pledge of $25, 000 by the Tribe for gambling services is not
enough and absurd. Crime does increase in areas with a casino and the University of Illinois
showed areas with casinos draw less business and lower property values. Its absurd to think that
the passage of this agreement would have no influence over whether there is federal approval of
the casino because it would show our community wants this agreement. This is profiteering off
of the backs of residents and children of residents who have addiction problems. This is profiting
off of people who will lose everything that they have. To say this is something we should
welcome and pay no mind to the negative effects of casinos is ridiculous. This entire deal was
done back room and announced as if it was a done deal. Never once did anyone from the City
come and ask what are the concerns of the people who oppose this casino. 

Patrick Mangun,  1919 S.  Michigan St.,  spoke as the president of the group Citizens for
Community Values, he stated we have had discussions over the last twenty (20)  of years on
quality of life issues and the better part of fifteen ( 15)  years shedding the horrible image that
South Bend was the porn capital of Michiana. We have instituted many policies to get rid of that
image. It is ridiculous to say that we need our vices and totally irresponsible. Our vices nearly
destroyed our city and it took a longtime for South Bend to become known as a great place to
live for families and great universities and colleges. To come to this point and have South Bend
become associated with another adult business that has a negative impact will be harmful. It is
wrong for us to turn away from being family friendly, we should not try to be a mini version of
Chicago. He stated looking at the gambling model, the reality is that people don' t stop at the
corner gas station or convenience store when going to the casino. The people come in and come
out. The businesses in the immediate facility have an increased amount of traffic which is
inconvenient for their current cliental. Most of those local businesses near that area will go out of
business.  He stated he would rather see this casino built somewhere else and not just go along
with our vices. 

Rhonda Richards,  1020 Clover St. South Bend, stated after reading through the resolution she
has a couple of concerns and questions. First, the Mayor who has shown that he wants to support

South Bend and is a veteran and patriot, why he is making an agreement with a sovereign nation

15

REGULAR MEETING

APRIL 11,  2015

when the federal government has not made that agreement yet.  Second, throughout this
agreement the Tribe retains its sovereignty and they can change their mind later and the City has
no recourse. This Tribe has changed their mind over the years, when they became a recognized
Tribe they claimed they didn' t want to start casinos and now they have changed their mind. 
There is no guarantee of this money over the long -term and there is no recourse we could have
because they are a sovereign nation. She stated she realizes the Mayor has worked diligently to
make sure South Bend gets something from this potential casino but is concerned that potential
money has clouded the potential for the increase in crime both violent and nonviolent. How does
giving money to these various groups help the family whose daughter gets raped or the family
who doesn' t have money for food because they are caught in addictions? Our federal government
has not okayed this yet but we are rushing into it. 

Kelly Havens,  12032 Timberline Trace N. Granger, Indiana 46530,  stated even though she is a
County resident she is speaking against the casino because it would affect the entire county and
Michiana region. The quality of life will change and hurt the residents near that proposed casino. 
This casino project takes a significant piece of property off the tax rolls and that is a problem for
a county that has the distinction of having the highest tax exempt properties in Indiana. It means
that whatever taxes will not be paid by the casino will be borne by the rest of the residents in the
county. This facility would not be subject to South Bend Code or South Bend ordinances.  We are
putting a lot of risk into this venture without considering all the possibilities. Most of money that
goes into this casino will come from South Bend, Mishawaka and St. Joe County residents and
that is money not being spent in grocery stores, retail stores and other establishments.  This is $ 50
million being sucked out of the local economy. Given those negatives, why should any elected
official be in favor of this? This agreement only grants two percent (2 %) out of the profits, not
the revenue, and that is ridiculous. Why would this Council ruin the Southwest side of the City
for that amount of money? When five (5)  years from now, and the quality of life has suffered in
South Bend, this City will regret this plan and this casino.  This plan will have an impact on the
federal decision. This Council would be selling the soul of St.  Joseph County for two cents on
the dollar and some shiny lollipops. 

Barry Bambaugh,  12032 Timberline Trace N. Granger, Indiana 46530,  opposed the casino for a
number of moral and ethical reasons but the biggest one is because of the sovereignty issue. The
U.S.  should not be giving out sovereign U.S.  soil to another sovereign nation, we cannot parcel
our nation apart. We are not giving England the ability to come buy land and call it sovereign
British soil. We should not be doing the same with the Potawatomi. That being said, because the
city cannot do much regarding ifthe casino can come here and cannot do anything about the
smoking issue, however the City did negotiate with these people and this would create a
monopoly sanctioned by this Council. The Council took away the private rights of the bars to
allow smoking and now this Council would allow the Potawatomi to have a monopoly on
smoking. Apparently, the agreement also opposes any other gaming that may come into the city
because the Potawatomi are afraid of competition. That part of the agreement should be stripped
from this bill. You do not have to give approval to this and renegotiate with the Tribe or take
away the non - smoking ordinance. 

Judith Overmyer, 3447 S.  Locust Dr., South Bend,  stated she lives closer to the proposed casino
than almost anyone in the City but that is not the only reason she opposes the casino. The casino
nowadays are slot machines that are controlled by the computer and people are guaranteed to
lose. Dowagiac in its first year had a $ 54 million revenue and only gave $2 million of that to the
city. The rest of that money was pocketed by the casino and sucked out of the community. 
Private casinos in Indiana pay in taxes a range from five percent ( 5 %)  to forty percent (40 %). 
The money being taken out of this casino is money that families should spend on clothes, 
services and local retail stores.  She requested that at least one councilmember votes against this
so when the Indians go try to get federal approval they cannot say the City unanimously supports
the casino.  The Federal Government knows casinos are bad and that is why there is a moratorium
on them,  South Bend should know that too. 

Susan Daniels,  1314 Huffinan Dr. South Bend IN, stated she is a private tutor and works largely
with students with problems. Those students largely, unfortunately, come from families with
problems.  She tries to help her students succeed and come to adult life to work and lead the next

16

REGULAR MEETING

APRIL 11,  2015

generation. The job of this Council is to make sure our community is safe, has a sound economy
and a place where our children and grandchildren want to live. There has not been nearly enough
talk about how the City will override the negative impact on the impoverished families in this
community. There are many families who live on the edge of responsibility, lets not give those
parents another reason for them to not be responsible and not take care of their children. That
impact on the schools is not going to be made up with this money. There are not enough teachers
and social workers to deal with the negative impact this will have on children, especially
impoverished children. This will not draw money to businesses in our area it will take it away. 

Keith D.  Schrock, Mishawaka, if this approval has no voice in the matter why is there going to
be a vote at all. This is wrong and is in the middle of a circle of casinos in the area. It is wrong
for South Bend, our community and the families in the area. 

Zack Asteo,  1140 E. Dayton St.  South Bend,  spoke against the casino as a young person in the
community. 

Council President Tim Scott stated the reason the time limits are in place is to allow the people in
favor of the motion and the people against the motion have a roughly equal amount of time. 

The petitioner was allowed a five (5)  minute rebuttal. 

Corporation Counsel Cristal Brisco responded that the land in trust application filed by the
Pokagon Band is a request for a restoration of the Pokagon Band' s homeland. The City of South
Bend does not have a valid lawful basis to challenge or interfere with the Pokagon Band' s
request that the 166 acre site is not restored to them as their ancestral homeland. Regarding the
City of South Bend' s possible recourse if the Pokagon Band changed their mind, the Band has
contractually obligated itself to the agreement and have passed a waiver of their sovereign
immunity for the enforcement of this agreement. As a part of that waiver they have subjected to
the application of South Bend Municipal Code Ordinance 13 -57,  13 -82 and 17 -18.  Those
ordinances deal with unreasonable noise and also discharge standards. 

Councilmember Dr. David Varner asked for the clarification that this type of agreement is not
required for Class Two gaming. 

Corporation Counsel Cristal Brisco responded yes that is the case.  There was no need for an

agreement. 

Councilmember Jo Broden expressed that while we have known (or should have known)  as a
community that negotiations have been undertaken with regard to this issue for some time (at the
federal,  state and local levels), the agreement before us really is an artfully crafted product of
understandably complicated, multi - layered considerations. After careful review, fact finding and
research, in my estimation, it carefully straddles the needs, interests,  and concerns of the
Pokagon Band of the Potawatomi Indians, as well as ours,  as a City.  It' s a strong contract. 

As such it' s loaded with some very significant benefits: 

First and foremost, it recognizes the inherent right of the Pokagon Band to take a significant step
in restoration of their homelands here in Indiana and to serve and meet the needs of the
descendants of this land' s native, indigenous people — people who are already our neighbors. As
such,  this agreement represents a stark contrast to treaties and agreements within our shared
ancestral history— for your people near extermination &  non - existence to this very definitive
path of self - determination as a people. 

Other pluses included dollars, recouped by this agreement, are any costs to be incurred by the
city for services to develop the site, for water and sewer or future services.  Additionally, there
are infrastructure benefits tucked in for the benefit of the surrounding neighborhoods. 

Most significantly, because it did not need to be done, there is money over and above these costs, 
in the form of payments in lieu of taxes that will accrue to the City and be captured by the City' s
general fund with an equal percentage going to our Redevelopment Authority.  Admittedly, my
preference would have been for that percentage to be tweaked or outright directed to the General
Fund where the choices and decisions about its use are scrutinized more publically through our

17

REGULAR MEETING

APRIL 11,  2015

City' s annual budget process.  To have this funding directed toward work force development, job
creation, anti- poverty measures and educational initiatives is a huge plus. 

This Council should rally behind and commit our City via the Redevelopment Commission to
roll up our sleeves and support, leverage in whatever manner possible early education initiatives. 
That is the focus where you get the most bang for your buck, where the return on investment is
highest in terms of truly changing lives and reversing the course of poverty.  Let' s get ahead of
the curve, leadership at the local level, working in partnership with the business community and
our strong educational institutions, is so sorely needed, especially when state leadership turns
down federal funding and woefully underfunds the efforts it does support.  Pilot programs for
early education aren' t enough. 

In terms of employment impact— short-and mid -term, the construction and trades industry will
be winners.  Even more so because of the Pokagon Band commitment to worker - friendly
provisions—  much like another large institution with whom our history intertwines, the
University of Notre Dame.  As we move forward, regardless of the project, it' ll be important to
adhere to quality standards, worker safety and living wages. 

Additionally, 2, 000 employees, their paychecks, combined with the stipulations to buy local and
support minority and women businesses —these are all big wins.  And not to be understated will
be the benefit from increased activity of consumers circulating in and among the southwest area
of our city. 

All this is indeed good news especially in light of tax caps &  the full brunt of those on city
services to come in 2019 and our need to grow our population and tax base. 

Undoubtedly, just as there are winners and gains, there will be adverse effects and losers. 

Businesses will pop up in response to the new opportunities and others that feel the heat, who
can' t make the pivot, will close doors.  Workers, if this follows the pattern in other venues, will
not have the benefit of a clean air -smoke free work environment nor will gainers.  I respectively
ask the dialogue and discernment around this issue to continue beyond what is here in writing. 
Let' s be attuned as an Administration and Council to supporting the small businesses to the
extent we are able. 

Undeniably, there will be folks amongst us who do not or cannot make responsible decisions
with regard to gaming.  Our community needs to echo the known fact that the `house always
wins'  and that addictions crush families and bring a different ripple effect.  Councilmember
Broden appreciated what she has heard and read regarding the Pokagon' s attentiveness to this
issue —to promote responsible play and to assist with intervention as needed.  However, we need
to be sure there is collaboration on this issue and that it is open,  generous, and truly meets
whatever needs arise here.  Access to and the affordability of quality addiction and mental health
services already is and will continue to be an on -going challenge for our community to strive to

meet. 

So too, there is benefit in here too for local not for profits.  They and the folks served will be

winners

The significant revenues earmarked here for parks and recreation equal the bond issue passed in
2015.  While Howard Park is an identified project, it' ll be important that the shape of that park

reflect both the desires of those most proximate to it in the 4th,  3rd district and downtown area, 
but the city as a whole.  It has always been a flagship park in our City' s history and its future by
necessity needs to be a collaborative process. 

So having discerned the many upsides for the Pokagon Band, for our residents, our local
economy AND with eyes wide open on the changes to come, Councilmember Jo M. Broden will
vote in favor of this agreement crafted by this Administration and already signed by the
sovereign Pokagon people. 

Let' s be better and good neighbors henceforth. 

Councilmember Randy Kelly stated he appreciates the excellent work of the Administration legal
team led by Cristal Brisco and appreciated her answering their questions, as well as the efforts of

the Administration negotiating with the Pokagon Band. He stated he has family who live near the
Four Winds Casino in New Buffalo and the Pokagon Band has been extraordinary partners with
New Buffalo and are regarded very highly. The beach communities near the casino have not
been negatively impacted in terms of property values or business development and continue to
thrive. 

Councilmember Regina Williams- Preston pointed out this is not the end. This establishes a long
term relationship with lots of time and space to continue to have a conversation with the Pokagon
Band on how our community can benefit from all the development that is coming.  She stated she
feels very positive with having that conversation with the Band as they have been so receptive so
far to South Bend and the other communities where they have casinos.  She reiterated that the
Council need to figure out better ways to communicate with the constituents so they can get their
input to us but also a lot of things that were talked about as problems are already problems in this
community and she would like to see those people who have concerns work to make them better
now. We already have many of those problems. This conversation needs to be happening
continually. It' s not about whether this casino comes or doesn' t come because we have problems
that need to be addressed period. There are a whole lot more problems with the School
Corporation and education in South Bend than a casino coming. She invited those who spoke on
that problem to work with the education issues now because then the impact of the casino would
not be as severe. There are lots of positive things such as jobs providing living wages with the
casino and opportunities to reimburse people for continued education. We are stronger as a
community if we come together to deal with those issues, those problems need to be addressed
whether the casino is coming or not. She stated that she will vote for the bill but does appreciate
that maybe somebody should vote against the bill just to represent that voice. What she heard
from her district is that this plan and casino is something they want to see. 

Council President Tim Scott thanked the councilmembers for doing their due diligence on this
issue. He thanked everyone who came out for and against the issue for being respectful.  This is a
democratic process,  not everyone is going to be happy with the outcome, but it is the process. 
This is the beginning and not the end of this conversation and this negotiation with the Band. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis made a motion to adopt Bill 16 -32.  Councilmember Randy Kelly
seconded the motion which carried by a roll call vote of eight (8)  ayes.

UNFINISHED BUSINESS

Councilmember Oliver Davis asked if the Council could get some communication on the
specifics of the new yard waste pick up because some residents have come to him saying it is
unclear about what they can and cannot put out. They are upset they got the pre- approved bag
and now need a pre- approved bin. 

Council President Scott stated he would follow up on that because he is meeting with Eric
Horvath because people in his district have not had clear communication on what is one ( 1)  cubic
yard. Every resident does get one ( 1) 

free pickup per month as he understands it. 

Councilmember Dr. David Varner stated he encourages the City to do one more city -wide spring
pickup because one last pickup on the old rules would help clean up a lot of confusion. 

Councilmember Jo M. Broden asked Chief of Staff James Mueller to find out if people have
physical hindrances if there is any support for yard cleapup. 

NEW BUSINESS

Councilmember Karen White announced that on Wednesday April 13th at 6: 00 p.m. the last
meeting of the Special Elbel Committee will be held in the Council Chambers. 

Councilmember Dr. David Varner sated the City has a huge problem with the Sewage Overflow
Issue and the potential $ 1 Billion price tag that comes with it. To help get the new Council up to
speed on the issue and Federal requirements he is going to hold a Utilities Committee Meeting
during the first or second week of May. The public is certainly welcome to attend that meeting as
well. It is a circumstance that a number on the Council believe the City cannot afford. 

PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR

Janet Petchuslki 1117 S.  31St St.,  spoke against the proposed fire. station at Potawatomi Park. 
While she appreciates the work the Fire Dept. does using public green space for the new station
is foolish. Yes this facility location would be ideal but there need to be considerations for the
park. There are very valuable places in this City and the parks should be off limits. A park is an
area where people can get away from the intensity of urban life. A fire station and its
accompanying noise and activity would damage the serenity of the current park. 

Samuel Brown, 222 E. Navarre St., thanked the Administration and Mayor for helping relocate
the radio antenna on top of the Chase Tower and moved to a proper place.  That radio station is
important to members of this community, it is work like that done behind the scenes that is really
important and he is proud of the City of South.Bend for their efforts. Mr. Brown also stated his
approval of the South Bend Tribune Editorial in support of the new MLK St.  The City needs to
come together, just like they did for the antenna, and find a proper street for the memory of Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr. 

Mike Pechulski,  1117 S.  31St St.,  stated he recently attended the presentation by the Fire Dept. on
their plan to obtain part of Potawatomi Park. Yes he understand the importance of the Fire Dept.

and the work they do but they should not use the park. That is a beautiful park and should not be
ruined. They have been looking at this for ten ( 10)  years and that is the best they found. Maybe
ideally the park works location wise except that is community property and you don' t take that
property for other things.  This is not a perfect world and there are other places they could find
for that facility. He urged the Council to try to stop the building of that facility on the park and
use the pressure available to them. We need to save our green spaces. 

ADJOURNMENT

There being no further business to come before the Council, President Tim Scott adjourned the
meeting at 9: 45 p.m.
