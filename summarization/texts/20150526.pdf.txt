REPORTS OF CITY OFFICES — KATHRYN ROOS

ANNOUNCEMENT: REPRESENTING THE CITY ADMINISTRATION WILL BE CHIEF OF

STAFF — KATHRYN ROOS

Kathryn Roos gave the city report in absence of Mayor Pete Buttigieg. 
Kathryn Roos,  Chief of Staff, Offices on the 14'  Floor of this building.  Kathryn reported that
Eric Horvath and Aaron Perry will be joining her to present this evening. Ms. Roos thanked the
volunteers for helping with the SB 150 Celebration.  She gave a special thanks to the city workers
and all those who worked overtime to make SB 150 happen. 

Aaron Perry,  217 S.  Michigan,  South Bend — Thank you for your support.  This weekend was a
high impact one -time event.  Nearly 60,000 people enjoyed the weekend, one way or another.  1
would like to thank the City Departments our Legal team down to our Security. We saw over
1, 000 volunteers helping to pull off this event. Although this was a onetime event, we do have
some lasting elements such as the river of lights as a result of this. Again, thank you for your
support, it has been a pleasure to serve in this role. 

Councilmember Henry Davis, Jr. — I participated in several ofthe events.  My question is how
much did, this cost from employee overtime to city workers, as the cost of doing business is
high?  How much did that weekend cost this city?  Aaron responded the price tag to the yearlong
celebration is $ 1. 2 million.  The City made a contribution of $150, 000, the rest was private
investors and fundraising.  Councilmember Davis stated the question wasn' t the yearlong
celebration but the cost for the weekend.  The cost of business is our public workers,  city

workers labor hours, lighting...  If you are unable to quantify that then let' s wait, but I will still
be looking to find out what those numbers are.  Aaron replied I am unable to answer that
question right now, as we are still putting the spread sheets together.  I am curious to find that
out too,  I would have to get back to you on that one. 

Councilmember Dr. Ferlic — I would like to congratulate Kathryn on the fundraisers for the River

Lights Project.  She was able to obtain $ 800,000 in contributions.  I was at the $ 7, 500- $15, 000
range that I was asking and only got turned down eight ( 8)  times.  Otherwise it was $ 7,500 and
above due to Kathryn' s efforts.  We now have two ( 2)  tax abatements both residential and a hotel

as a result of events like this.  Thank you Aaron you deserve kudos on a job well done. 

Councilmember Dr. Varner — I would like to also thank everyone that was involved.  I almost
brought Aaron to tears when I told him how well everything was going.  With regards to the
lighting ofthe river, how do we continue that?  Does it grow or does it evolve?  Aaron responded
that the River of Lights will evolve into a park.  We were selling $50 rings as a part of it; so that
will come later on this summer.  The possibilities are endless in terms of architectural lighting. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis —Thank you, I truly enjoyed myself out there with my daughter. 
Do we see anything happening 4"  of July?  There was talk that we could never have an ethnic
festival,  due to security, with this event being successful why not be able to reopen that to an
annual thing?  Aaron responded we have a program already setup for certain Holidays including
the 4"  of July in terms of lighting.  As far as the festival, I' m not sure if we have the resources to
do it every year but is something we can look at. Councilmember Davis replied I don' t mind the
investment as it gives us something to do or else people will go to Chicago or Detroit.  Kathryn
responded I think the great thing you are pointing out, is how we plan for other activities and
events in our community.  We do need to sit down and figure out something that will be feasible
for us to do. 

Councilmember Mr. Ferlic — Congrats Kathryn for doing this with private investment.  Thank
you Aaron for working on this.  This was incredible what you pulled off especially from an all - 
volunteer basis. 

Councilmember White — Again, congratulations it was a great event.  I appreciate the diversity
throughout the event.  I would like to recognize the volunteers,  public safety, city administration, 
and everyone that made this possible.  It shows when we come together as a community we can
pull off anything as we are committed to the City of South Bend. 

Council President Scott — I agree with everything already stated.  I look forward to seeing the
financials from the event as well.  I have new copies of the proclamation as the other ones got

rained on. 

Kathryn Roos —The last person I would like to recognize is Rob DeCleene, ( Visit
SouthBend/ Mishawaka) he was on our Executive Committee.  He did a tremendous job on
marketing and promoting the event with giving his expertise.  Thank you. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis — Have you done studies on what other cities are doing when they
have their annuals?  Aaron responded it is interesting to see where we are compared to other
cities.  It is a dying breed as some cities such as Chicago and Mishawaka do not have them
anymore.  So it was incredible to know that we could pull something like this off. 
Councilmember Davis inquired it would be nice to see if we can do this biannually instead of
waiting another (25)  twenty -five years as I would like to still be around. 

Eric Horvath, Public Works Director, Offices on 13"  Floor — Quick update on the Curb and
Sidewalk Program.  The one scheduled for the city crew was sent out today which should stay on
schedule.  The second program for homeowners has been rolled out and we have one of those
already complete.  We currently have twenty on the list, and is growing in demand.  We are
bidding out other work for curbs and sidewalks which we will be advertising on July 9'  and
rewarding to those on July 14th.  As a separate bid we will have the Perry Project.  We received
proposals today on that, all of that goes through State approval and will happen this fall.  We are
currently out for request for proposals for Lincoln and Perley schools for next year. 

E

REGULAR MEETING

MAY 26,  2015

Councilmember Oliver Davis — Regarding the Harrison School project, I would like to have a
meeting to present to the community.  As it will be helpful for them to be aware of all the work
going on.  Eric responded I will be happy to have a public meeting as that school is extremely
involved in the process. 

Councilmember Dr. Varner — You were kind to mention the updates on other streets.  Any
updates on Ewing Avenue?  Eric responded the four blocks of Ewing, will be a part of the bid
process going out in July. 

Councilmember Dr. Ferlic — What percentage will be done by the city versus outsourced?  Eric
responded I don' t have that percentage off hand, but significantly more will be outsourced.  The
city does about one ( 1)  mile a year where we have five (5)  mile projects.  It will be close to 10% 
of city work and the rest outsourced. 

Councilmember Henry Davis, Jr. — One thing that I am in fear of is two - percent of the city does
not have sidewalks or sewer systems.  The question is how we get to a level where the two - 
percent is taken care of Eric responded we obviously have existing deteriorated sidewalks prior
to getting in new sidewalks but we are filling in as we go as well.  Councilmember Davis
responded I would like that 2%  to be a part of the conversation and a part of the budget as well. 

Council President Scott — I would like to reiterate the same thing, where there isn' t any
sidewalks.  We need to map a priority for our sidewalks and the time span on when that will be
occurring.  We will be asking for this from Council and following up with your administration. 

Councilmember Henry Davis, Jr. — For reference for Councilmember Oliver Davis the Taste of
Chicago will be happening July 8th-  July 12t' in Grant Park. 

RESOLVE INTO THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE
At 7: 29 p.m. Council President Scott requested a motion to resolve into the Committee of the

MAY 26,  2015

Council Attorney Cekanski- Farrand requested a motion to accept both substitute bill 15 -31 and
15 -32.  So moved by Councilmember Oliver Davis.  Councilmember Mr. Ferlic seconded the
motion which carried by a voice vote of seven ( 7)  ayes. 

Councilmember Gavin Ferlic, Chairperson, Community Investment Committee met this
afternoon and send bill 15 -31 and 15 -32 to the full Council favorably. 

Presenter: Chris Fielding,  14"  Floor Dept. of Community Investment — We have two bills before
you.  One is for a vacant building of the former Football Hall of Fame that will be built and the
other on the Jefferson lot to be continuous as one building.  The company plans to move their
Corporate headquarters to the top of the building as well.  The value of the two ( 2)  year
abatement to be paid over the life of the abatement $ 65, 961.  Total Taxes to be abated $ 107, 800, 
and total taxes to be paid $ 86, 900 a year moving forward.  This will turn the Hall of Fame to a
tax paying entity.  For the Jefferson Lot we offered a ( 9)  nine -year tax abatement, the taxes to be
paid will be $ 1, 464,000, total taxes to abated over the ( 9)  nine -year period $945, 000.  In addition
it will create thirty -eight (38)  new jobs.  Total investment is between $9 and $ 12 million dollars. 

Petitioner: A.J.  Patel,  247 N. Dixie Way,  South Bend— President &  CEO of JSK Development
and Hospitality. 

Councilmember Henry Davis, Jr. — I have a question for Mr. Fielding with the hotels downtown. 
During a previous conversation there was a cap on the number of rooms that can be provided in a
given area.  So how will this hotel affect others within this area?  Chris Fielding replied the
hotels that operate downtown will work together to attract business to the Century Center. 
Having the Century Center there will allow for two hotels to be attached which will allow for us
to host conferences of about 350 people.  There are plans to remodel the Chase Towers and these
hotels will not have any bearing on each other.  Councilmember Davis asked has the number
changed for us to grow at a higher level, what has occurred to expand our market?  Chris
responded we are attracting more people to our community, and that buzz creates business.  In
the past new construction hotels was not something we were looking at. We now have businesses
like Mr. Patel that are interested in investing millions in our market and investing another $7
million on the Southside.  I am pretty sure after seeing his portfolio he knows what he' s doing. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis asked where on the Southside.  Mr. Patel responded on the comer
of Ireland and Michigan.  Councilmember Davis responded welcome aboard. 

This being the time heretofore set for the Public Hearing on the above bill, proponents and
opponents were given an opportunity to be heard. 

Those wishing to speak in favor: 

Samuel Brown, 222 E. Navarre St.,  South Bend— I represent Citizens United for a Better

Government.  My only issue is that we already have the Chase Tower and it has never been done
right.  Are we going to be able to accommodate them to being a growing part of South Bend or
will it be like the Hall of Fame? 

Rebuttal:  Chris Fielding — In terms of the Chase Tower this bill is not about the Chase Tower. 
The Chase Tower is in the best economic stand point that it has been in years;  not in a physical

standpoint.  This is the first time we have had one owner for the Chase Tower there is a plan now

that allow for others to work with them with the receiver and titleholders out of the way. 

There being no one present wishing to speak to the Council in opposition to this bill, 
Councilmember Mr. Gavin Ferlic made a motion to adopt substitute version of 15 -31. 
Councilmember Dr. Fred Ferlic seconded the motion which carried and the Resolution was
adopted by a roll call vote of seven ( 7)  ayes.

REGULAR MEETING

MAY 26,  2015

Councilmember Gavin Ferlic, Chairperson, Community Investment Committee met this
afternoon and send bill 15 -39 to the full Council favorably. 

Presenter: Chris Fielding,  14"  Floor Dept. of Community Investment — Before you have a
resolution for a ( 10)  ten year real property tax abatement.  This is a partnership between the
historic JMS building, LLC, Great Lakes Capital, and Earth Design. They are looking to invest
approximately $ 7.6 million into the building creating 60 -68 apartments above the current
commercial space.  There will be no office space above the first floor.  The return on investment
is five ( 5)  years,  creating eight ( 8)  new jobs. Total taxes to be paid over the ten ( 10)  year period
are $ 2, 121, 000, and total taxes to be abated over the ten ( 10)  year period are $ 630,000.  They are
currently purchasing three numbers,  but only doing the abatement for one number. 

Petitioner: Frank Perry, 3617 McKinley Ave,  South Bend — I own a minority consulting firm, as
I am the minority partner.  We would be creating 60 -68 apartments,  high -end apartments.  I am
excited about bringing this project.  We are in the final stages and looking to deliver apartments
around June of next year. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis — Can you address the parking in that area with 60 new homes
coming?  Chris Fielding responded the third attachment on your handout highlights the parking
to the north ofthe JMS.  Great Lakes owns the parking lot to the east of the building, and have
leased spaces from the main street building garage.  Councilmember Davis asked what happens
with their guest when they come to visit.  Chris replied any time after 5pm the parking garages
are free, and with two street conversions there will be additional street parking available. 

Councilmember Dr. David Varner — With regards to the high -end finishes what is the dimensions
of the apartment?  Frank replied the average will be north of 850 sq.  ft., there will be studio and
one bedroom apartments.  They will run in price from $700 to $ 1600 depending upon view and

space. 

Councilmember Henry Davis — I think this is a great idea.  My question is with all the projects
going on when is the last time we did a market study on where we are economically, especially
when I haven' t seen an influx in new jobs?  Where is this money going to come from to support
all these new developments?  Chris responded we did commission a study in 2012, by a national
urban housing establishment, which gave an S. W.O.T. analysis that estimated downtown could
absorb 5 downtown housing units. We are still significantly under that number. Urban living is a
shift in our culture now, and South Bend plans to capitalize on that.  Councilmember Davis
stated I don' t want our City to end up like what happened to Mishawaka.  I' m simply asking
these questions to avoid those things. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis — If all these apartments come downtown, what groceries stores are
coming downtown as we don' t have a convenient place for them to go?  Chris replied there is a
grocery store a block from downtown. We have a smaller market down the street.  It has always
been a question do we build the apartments or the grocery store.  We build the living space and
businesses will see the opportunity to build. 

Councilmember Henry Davis, Jr. — Is this the reason why we went to the two -lane streets for $40
million?  Was that a part ofthe market study for new business and how traffic flows downtown? 
Chris responded they did not recommend that we did that, however it is one of the catalyst for
growth downtown, and why you see retail space created under the hotel. I can' t give you an
answer but it all plays together as part of the vision.  Councilmember Davis responded if that is
the case then why was it not in the study?  Chris replied we had already told them we would be
doing the two -way streets,  without it we had no reason to do the study. 

This being the time heretofore set for the Public Hearing on the above bill, proponents and
opponents were given an opportunity to be heard. 

There being no one present wishing to speak to the Council either in favor of or opposition to
this bill, Councilmember Mr. Gavin Ferlic made a motion to adopt this resolution.

REGULAR MEETING

MAY 26,  2015

Presenter: Randy Rompola, 202 S.  Michigan St,  South Bend — We are here for you to consider
the adoption of this resolution.  This would increase the amount not to exceed tax exempt bonds

issued on behalf of Noble Americas.  At the time you adopted the fire resolution, the amount was
not to exceed $25 million, since that time the company has invested a greater amount of money
in the project overall.  With respect to the bonds,  they are being suggested for issuance at the
project conclusion.  The bonds would not be an obligation to the city.  In order for them to issue
tax exempt bonds, they would need to be issued by the city. With the issuance the city is not
responsible and not held responsible.  The payment would be between the company and the
bank.  At this point they are looking to not exceed $ 15 million.  We are asking you to amend the
prior resolution to preserve the ability to issue the bonds going forward. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis stated what you are sharing with us,  is if something happens with
Noble America, if they go out of business this will not affect the city?  That their success or
failure would not be liable by the city at all?  Randy responded correct at no circumstances
would the city be responsible if they were to default on their loans. 

This being the time heretofore set for the Public Hearing on the above bill, proponents and
opponents were given an opportunity to be heard. 

There being no one present wishing to speak to the Council either in favor of or opposition to
this bill, Councilmember White made a motion to adopt this resolution. Councilmember Dr.

County Assessors with a bill that deals with assessments that impacts our citizens which will be
held at the Council. 

NEW BUSINESS

Councilmember Henry Davis, Jr. stated he is noticing the lack of attention towards our citizens. 
There is a lack of presence by our Mayor at our Council meetings.  With my level of experience
the expectations are not clear from the Mayor' s Office.  The city council constantly has
unanswered questions that have been disregarded or lied to.  We deserve factual information, we
have to have clear and transparent conversations that are going on. 

Council President Tim Scott in no offence to the Mayor, he did send me a text that he will not be
in today' s meeting as he is at conference.  Of course that only accounts for today' s meeting.

REGULAR MEETING

MAY 26,  2015

Jesse Davis — P. O.  Box 10205,  South Bend— SB 150 was a great gathering Aaron, but I have a
couple concerns on how much did this cost the taxpayers,  as the majority of the donations were
political. I have a problem with the SB 150 webpage with smoking prohibited in public areas as
well as professional camera' s,  and weapons.  The people who wrote this should be held
accountable.  This was sent to the NRA as this violated our rights. 

Samuel Brown — 222 E. Navarre St.,  South Bend — I represent the group Citizens United for a
Better Government.  I remember the old South Bend with car dealerships,  movie theatres...  We
have brought businesses that were supposed to help the city but have not. 

Jason Banicki- Critchlow— 3822 W. Ford St.,  South Bend— I was born and raised on the
Westside.  I was at a meeting where I listened to the Mayor tell us that the $ 2 million spent to
redevelop streets and sidewalks was not a plan but just a vision.  The ethnic diversity, the income
diversity has been jeopardized by gentrification. We want to stay who we are,  we love the
Westside as it is.  There is no coherent plan on fixing poverty rather than just trying to avoid it. 
We need to sit down with the housing authority and the projects to develop true multi - income

neighborhoods. 

ADJOURNMENT
There being no further business to come before the Council, President Tim Scott adjourned the
meeting at 8: 34 p.m.
