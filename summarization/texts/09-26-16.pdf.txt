Councilmember Karen White, Chair of the Personnel and Finance Committee, reported that they
met and send this forward with a favorable recommendation. 

John Murphy, City Controller with offices on the 12th Floor of the County -City Building, served
as the petitioner for this bill. This is the substitute ordinance that includes the change we made in
Committee this afternoon. The largest item is the $500, 000 appropriation for the street repairs as
a result of the flooding that occurred recently. We filed that claim with our insurance carrier and
any reimbursements we receive will be redeposited back into the COIT fund. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis asked what is going to happen with Chippewa Avenue repairs. 

Mr. Murphy stated he will defer to the Engineering Department. 

Jitin Kain, Deputy Director of Public Works, responded that in regard to Chippewa we are
working with the County on repairing the street as both the City and County portions of the road
were damaged. We are trying to assess what the City' s role will be in addressing those damages. 

Councilmember Davis asked what the timeline is for reopening the road. 

Mr. Kain responded they are trying to do their best to get it done quickly. The issue is with the
culvert that was damaged during the flood and replacing that can take time. 

Councilmember Davis asked that the department send a notice to the people who live in the area
on when the road will be finished. 

Mr. Cain responded certainly and they will send it to the City Clerk' s Office. 

No one from the public spoke in favor or opposition to the bill.

fund. The EMS is an appropriation for a debt service payment. The last two (2)  are to close out
bond issuance cost funds.  When a new bond is issued, the bond council will ask to put the
issuance costs into a separate fund so that they can keep track of those separately. The issuance
costs were less than anticipated so those funds can be transferred to cover debt service payments. 

There were no questions from Council.

Councilmember Oliver Davis made a motion to accept Substitute Bill 46 -16 on file with the City
Clerk. Councilmember Dr. David Varner seconded the motion which carried by a voice vote of
nine ( 9)  ayes. 

Councilmember Karen White, Chair of the Personnel and Finance Committee,  reported that they
met and send these bills forward with no recommendation. 

John Murphy, City Controller with offices on the 12th Floor of the County -City Building, served
as the petitioner for these bills. Mr. Murphy gave a power point presentation to explain some of
the information contained in the budget and that presentation is on file with the City Clerk. We
have had a number of public meetings and it has been a good process and we appreciate the
Council working diligently with us.  Mr. Murphy thanked Jennifer Hockenhull, the City' s Deputy
Controller who put the Power Point together and has done an amazing job during this budget
process. 

The City budget is a complicated process.  There are one - hundred and ten ( 110)  funds. The
General Fund is the primary fund. We have thirty -seven ( 37)  special revenue funds. There are
seventeen ( 17)  debt service and capital funds.  We have twenty -five (25)  enterprise funds and
internal service funds service the rest of the government. There are also a number of
redevelopment funds that the Redevelopment Commission approves but are also presented so
that the Council has a complete picture of the budget. 

REGULAR MEETING

SEPTEMBER 26,  2016

The budget process began in February with a Priority Based Budgeting kickoff meeting. It has
been a beneficial and interesting process to do the Priority Based Budgeting model. On June 7th
we had the budget kickoff meeting and on August 15"  the Mayor gave a budget overview to
Council. We have had a number of budget hearings within the Personnel and Finance
Committee.  October 10th,  2016 is the proposed budget adoption meeting and our due date is
November 1St,  2016. The DLGF will set our property tax rates by February 15th 2017. Next year
they are accelerating that so they will get it done by December 31St of the year which is good
because you' d like to have your property tax rates known before you start the new year. 

Mr. Murphy gave a breakdown of the 2017 budget priorities which include: Safe community for
everyone, a strong and inclusive economy, thriving public spaces, vibrant and welcoming
neighborhoods, robust and well planned infrastructure,  and that all residents are empowered with
education, mobility and technology. 

Mr. Murphy presented the slides that have a breakdown of where money is being allocated under
those specific priorities. He suggested the Council and public have a good look at them because a
lot of well - funded programs are spelled out. Police and fire protection is a high priority for the
City and approximately $70 million is budgeted which is approximately twenty percent (20 %) of
the budget. A new department titled Venues, Parks and Arts is being proposed in this budget to
better and more efficiently serve the community and will encompass the Morris, Palais, Century
Center and Parks.  In order to provide vibrant neighborhoods, $ 200, 000 is budgeted for Light Up
South Bend. That is funded out of the COIT Fund. There is $ 625, 000 to address Vacant & 
Abandoned Properties. This budget has $ 1. 5 million dedicated to curbs and sidewalks that does
not include an estimated $ 3, 620,000 in federal reimbursements anticipated as well. The City' s
minimum wage is in a three ( 3)  prong step and is scheduled to increase to $ 9. 15 in 2017. That is
about a $61, 000 impact which is primarily from the Park' s budget. 

The overall budget is $316, 540,989 in revenue which is up eight percent ( 8 %)  from last year. We
have added some trustee funds that we have never included in our budget before and that alters
the numbers slightly. For the first time in City history, we have every fund that is in our reporting
entity in the budget. The expenditures are $ 366,840,595 which is down one percent ( 1 %) 
last year. 

from

Due to the circuit breaker we are expecting a $3. 05 million drop off in property taxes in 2020. 
We are estimating an approximate ten percent ( 10 %)  increase in the local income tax revenue
over last year. That is based on a DLGF estimate from July, we are waiting till the end of
September for a certified amount. This is very helpful for our 2017 budget. 

Mr. Murphy presented a breakdown of the budgeted revenue and expenditures by activity. He
then gave a chart that provides a benchmark of other similar sized cities compared to South Bend
and analyzes per capita general government expenditures which are typically called " overhead" 
or administrative costs.  South Bend is at five percent ( 5 %)  which fairs comparable to other cities
like Springfield Illinois which is at seventeen ( 17 %).  We feel like our general governmental
expenses are in line with our peer cities. A chart was presented that had the breakdown of
budgeted expenditures by funds and another by type. 

The budget calls for 1, 121 full -time positions in 2017 which is a net increase of eleven ( 11)  full - 
time employees. That number has police at two hundred and ninety -seven ( 297), Fire/EMS at
two - hundred and sixty -four (264),  and Public Works at three - hundred and one ( 301).  Those are
the three ( 3)  big departments in the City. 

The City has won the Distinguished Budget Presentation Award two (2)  years in a row and the
team is really proud of that. 

South Bend has a double A bond rating with Standard &  Poor. That is very good for a City of
our size and situation but we are working to get to triple A. 

The City budget maintains our city' s comeback through: continued investment in our
neighborhoods, city center, and people, use of technology and efficiency to drive results, 
maintaining resources needed to keep high levels of service, and measuring our performance for
continuous improvement. The City continues to budget responsibly as we look towards the 2020

REGULAR MEETING

SEPTEMBER 26.  2016

Fiscal Curb and respectfully asks the Council to approve our 2017 budget request on October
10'h,  2016. 

Councilmember Karen White asked if the minimum wage increase affects only full time
employees or is it directed towards all positions. 

Mr. Murphy responded it includes all positions. The majority of the individuals would be in the
Parks Department. We have an estimate of where all the various positions are broken down at the
department level that can be sent to the Council. 

Councilmember White asked when would the goal of being at $ 10. 10 an hour be reached. 

Mr. Murphy responded the goals would be to be at that level for the beginning of 2018. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis asked how much the increase in the LOIT will be in terms of
dollars. 

Mr. Murphy responded that it is an estimated increase of $2. 7 million. 

Councilmember Davis asked if there was any discussion to move up the minimum wage increase
to this year and have it at $ 10. 10 for 2017. He recommended raising the lower level positions to
that number with that extra money before we start increasing the other positions that are higher
salaried. It makes more sense that when we get extra money to take care of those struggling at
the lower pay ranges. 

Mr. Murphy responded we had a number of gaps in funding and currently the way we are
spending down COIT we used this money to close those gaps for 2017. Long term we still have
an issue with the fiscal curb but this did help close deficits. 

Councilmember Davis stated over the next few weeks as we look at this, we should consider
raising the minimum wage to $ 10. 10 this year. 

Councilmember Dr. David Varner asked what is the difference between a double A and a single
A bond rating in terms of issuance rates. 

Mr. Murphy responded that it is significant but he doesn' t know for sure off the top of his head
but it does make a large difference over twenty (20)  years. 

Councilmember Dr. David Varner stated that we are making some of these expenditure
assumptions with several negotiations underway. He asked what the City used in regards to
Teamsters,  Police, and Fire for the budget estimates. 

Mr. Murphy stated we didn' t assume a certain percentage but we did place some money in the
budget for increases. If negotiations goes well we feel comfortable that we could bring the
General Fund, COIT, EDIT and Public Safety LOIT into balance which would be a significant
achievement because those are our core funds.  We' ll be adjusting the budget after the
negotiations are settled. 

Councilmember Davis asked what page should he go to see the money that the City is spending
on fixing up the streets. 

Mr. Muprhy responded he should go to the Motor Vehicle Highway Fund which is on page two - 
hundred and two ( 202). 

Councilmember Davis stated people want to know that their streets and curbs are taken care of. 
People want to see that their neighborhoods and not just downtown are being fixed up. 

Mr. Murphy responded there is a new LOIT, the 2016 LOIT fund of $4. 1 million dollars
designed only for streets.  There are some appropriations in this year' s budget and in next year' s
budget.  That is Fund #257, for next year we budgeted $2. 13 million dollars for street
improvement which is brand new and we have never had that prior to this year. That is a positive
for streets that the Council could point to. 

No one from the public spoke in favor of the bills. 

Those wishing to speak in opposition: 

REGULAR MEETING

SEPTEMBER 26,  2016

Jesse Davis, P. O. Box 10205 South Bend IN, stated listening to what Councilmember Davis just
said about salaries makes more sense than anything he has heard at these Council meetings. 
People are tired of the upper echelon getting caviar when the people at the bottom are eating dog
food. The City has been fully aware of the circuit breakers since 2008 which is almost nine (9) 
years ago.  The City created a new LOIT tax and then doubled it the next year and created a brand
new public safety tax and all the taxes keep going up and up. Everybody in Indiana except St. 
Joseph County and Lake County have been capped at one percent ( 1 %)  and South Bend got a
reprieve from that. We had nine ( 9)  years to prepare for this and worry about the spending.  The
City has no right to cut our services and every year taxes go up and people in government want
raises. Mr. Davis asked how much Smart Streets will eventually cost the taxpayers of South
Bend. He stated people on fixed incomes are not seeing cost of living raises so neither should
these City employees. To raise the taxes back because they will be capped, the government is
raising the assessments on properties. If the City is worried about this fiscal cliff coming and the
CSO project, we should be slowing the spending. We have already separated those sewers but
when we had a torrential rainfall the neighborhoods were flooding with sewage. This spending is
totally out of control. It would also be really nice if we could see what our tax dollars were spent
on and see the actual amounts. There should be no raises if we have this fiscal cliff. 

Sharon Banicki, 3822 Ford Street South Bend, stated she is against this budget. There is one ( 1) 
raise in the budget that pops out at her as inappropriate.  She stated within thirty (30)  minutes she
went to the two (2)  cities that are above of us and their city clerks are not making near what our
City Clerk is asking for. 

Chairperson Gavin Ferlic stated that salary is not in this hearing. That particular item is not
within this hearing but will be at the hearing in two (2)  weeks. 

Ms. Banicki continued and stated this Council has known for nine ( 9)  years that this fiscal curb
was coming and it is a shame that more people are not here to voice their concerns. We are tired
of not being listened to. We are tired of the government telling us what we need and what we
want and should do. Quit spending money that we don' t have to support all of these programs. 

Pam Clays,  1106 Belleview, applauded Councilmember Davis on his comments.  If it is $ 60, 000
to bring people up to $9. 10 we should really consider bumping that up to the $ 10. 10 a year
earlier. She urged the Council to figure out that math. 

Councilmember Randy Kelly made a motion to continue Bill 44 -16 in the Council portion only
and set the third reading for October 10th 2016. Councilmember Tim Scott seconded the motion
which carried by a voice vote of nine ( 9)  ayes. 

Councilmember Karen White wished to remind the public that they will have an opportunity for
public input at Pinhook on Monday October 3rd,  2016 at 6: 00 p.m. We also have another budget
hearing scheduled for October 6th,  2016 at 5: 30 p.m. in the Council conference room. The
Council does listen to the public and we are trying to come up with the best budget possible for

everyone. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis made a motion to continue Bill 45 -16 in the Council portion only
and set the third reading for October 10th 2016.  Councilmember Tim Scott seconded the motion
which carried by a voice vote of nine ( 9)  ayes. 

Councilmember Karen White made a motion to continue Substitute Bill 46 -16 in the Council

BEELER COURT, COUNCILMANIC DISTRICT
NO.  1 IN THE CITY OF SOUTH BEND, 
INDIANA

REGULAR MEETING

SEPTEMBER 26,  2016

Councilmember Oliver Davis, Chair of the Zoning and Annexation Committee, reported that
they met and send this forward with a favorable recommendation. 

Keith Chapman, Area Plan Commission with offices on the 1 Ith Floor of the County -City
Building, served as the presenter for this bill. Mr. Chapman displayed a Power Point slide which
is on file in the City Clerk' s Office. The petitioner is requesting a rezoning from Light Industrial
to General Business District. On site is an existing sales and service building. To the north is
vacant land, to the east is a parking lot and to the south and west are industrial businesses zoned
LI Light Industrial.  This comes to the Council with a favorable recommendation from the Area
Plan Commission. Rezoning this property to General Business will allow for an existing business
to continue operations and expand to include onsite sales of motor vehicles which is a use that is
compatible to surrounding industrial uses. 

Garry Potts, Owner of Professional Permits with offices at 58171 Dragon Fly Court Osceola IN, 
representing Cook Land Group, represented the petitioner of this bill. The petitioner had
previously rented a building on Cleveland Rd. within the industrial park and in December
purchased a building and renovated it for the purposes of having an indoor showroom. They
provide vans and SUVs with lowered floors and other modifications for the handicap in order to
enable them to drive. The City has required this zoning to keep everything as it should be and to
provide landscape relief. 

There were no questions from Council. 

No one from the Council spoke in favor of or in opposition to the bill. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis made a motion to send Bill 40 -16 to the full Council with a

INDIANA, COMMONLY KNOWN AS 7250

VORDEN PKWY, SOUTH BEND, IN 46628 AS
AN ECONOMIC REVITALIZATION AREA FOR
PURPOSES OF A FIVE ( 5)  YEAR PERSONAL

PROPERTY TAX ABATEMENT FOR 3B TECH, 

INC. 

Sarah Heintzelman, Department of Community Investment with offices on the 14th Floor of the
County -City Building, served as the presenter for this bill. This is a five (5)  year personal
property tax abatement for 3B Tech. They are making a private investment of $640, 000. New
taxes generated will be $ 54, 904 of which $25, 200 would be abated.  One - hundred ( 100)  new jobs
would be created from this project with an annual payroll of over $3. 5 million. 

Mike Johnson, 3B Tech with offices at 7250 Vorden Parkway, served as the petitioner for this
bill. The company is expanding and outgrowning their existing building. We will still maintain
both facilities and will use the help from the tax abatement to help speed the growth of that
proj ect. 

There were no questions from Council. 

No one from the public spoke in favor of the bill. 

Those wishing to speak in opposition: 

Jesse Davis, P. O.  Box 10205 South Bend IN, spoke against the bill. This huge fiscal cliff is
coming up and we shouldn' t grant these tax abatements.  We need to ask all companies coming
for tax abatements if they will still expand their company without this tax abatement. That is a
question that needs to be asked of every company before granting more tax abatements.  If the
City wants to keep spending the resident' s tax dollars,  you have to quit walking away from tax
dollars from businesses.

SAMPLE STREET, SOUTH BEND, IN 46619 AS
AN ECONOMIC REVITALIZATION AREA FOR
PURPOSES OF A FIVE (5)  YEAR PERSONAL
PROPERTY TAX ABATEMENT FOR
INDUSTRIAL METAL -FAB, INC. 

Sarah Heintzelman, Department of Community Investment with offices on the 14th Floor of the
County -City Building, served as the presenter for this bill. This is a tax abatement for Industrial
Metal -Fab who are looking to invest $520, 000 in private investment. New taxes created will be
71, 105 and an abatement of that would be $ 20, 167. They are looking to create ten ( 10)  new jobs
with over $ 300, 000 in annual payroll. 

Councilmember Davis asked how much of that $71, 105 of tax is currently coming in now. 

Ms. Heintzelman responded none of that. Over the total time period of the abatement the amount
of taxes created would $71, 105 but right now it is $ 0 because the amount of new money they are
going to be investing will generate these new taxes. Right now none of that money is coming in
and none of it will come in unless they make this investment. 

Councilmember Davis asked how is this different than the housing abatements that we give. 

Ms. Heintzelman responded that the taxes that are going to be generated are primarily going to
be for the revitalization area and that money will go back into infrastructure work. It is also
going to be separate from money that is going to come in from residential properties. For some
of these businesses like IMF, they are landlocked and cannot continue to grow in South Bend. 
This is also for them a very large capital expenditure and one that we can help to ease by doing
this. They may not make this investment without this abatement. This is an opportunity to help
some of these local businesses who are then tied to South Bend because the tax abatements are
going to bring in additional people who will be working in the community. 

Councilmember Davis asked if there has been talk of this company leaving that spot. 

Ms. Heintzelman responded yes there has been and they are currently on Sample right now
which is not a really good area for us to lose any more businesses because it has been primarily
industrial for a long time. This has been a locally owned business for over fifty (50)  years. If we
can do something to help them and keep them here that is a worthwhile expenditure on our part
particularly because we are not taking money out of the coffers right now but simply abating
money that they have not even invested yet. If they were to not invest this money and move then
we would lose everything that is already there. 

Council President Scott stated he wants to remind the Council that these are confirming
resolutions. We have heard these abatements almost verbatim with the same data two (2)  weeks
ago.  Once we approved it two (2)  weeks ago they come back for the confirming before they go
down state. 

Kyle Bodwig, Industrial Metal Fab 2806 W. Sample Street, served as the petitioner for this bill. 
The company has been located at that location since 1964 and is landlocked and looking to
expand our capabilities to remain competitive in today' s environment. This would help us stay at
that location without having to relocate somewhere else. 

Councilmember Davis asked how this specifically helps them stay at that location. 

Mr. Bodwig responded that they are at the point where they cannot keep up with their current
workload and need to add some new machinery. They can' t add the machinery until they have
the space. The alternative to this would be to not meet our customer' s demands or look
elsewhere or be creative with where we are at. 

Councilmember Williams- Preston asked if the company does not get this abatement, in the next
five (5)  years would they be looking to move. 

Mr. Bodwig responded moving would be an option on the table. The idea of moving has come
up prior to this and this was an idea he personally took upon himself before they started looking

12

REGULAR MEETING

SEPTEMBER 26,  2016

elsewhere. Moving is an option that has been looked at. We wanted to find a way to stay where
we are at while also meeting our customer' s demands. 

Those wishing to speak in favor of the two ( 2)  bills: 

Jesse Davis, P. O Box 10205 South Bend IN, spoke in favor of the bills. He stated he is definitely
not anti - business and is a very small business himself and sometimes he struggles. There are
probably instances where tax abatements are necessary. A better question to further this
discussion is will the business leave South Bend if they do leave. We have built some pretty nice
speck buildings in the City for businesses.  It is not just a matter of will the company move but
will they move out of the City. Even when that happens like when AM General moved from
Mishawaka to South Bend. This Council gave them a tax abatement, but they get government
contracts. All their work is paid for with our tax dollars but we still gave them a tax abatement
and they weren' t creating any new jobs here. They were just moving a facility from South Bend
to Mishawaka. They were still part of the St. Joseph County community and bottom line they
weren' t creating any new jobs. There may be instances where these are necessary but we need to
look a little closer at those. This might be an instance where this is feasible. 

No one from the public spoke in opposition. 

Councilmember Gavin Ferlic made a motion to adopt Bill 16 -69.  Councilmember Oliver Davis

333, 374 of which $126, 224 would be abated. This would create twenty -five (25)  new jobs over
the course of this project with over $780, 000 in annual payroll.

Joseph Roland, CFO of Imagineering Enterprises at 1302 W. Sample Street, served as the
petitioner of this bill. We are looking at expanding our business and in doing so expanding the
real estate and buying some new equipment as well. This expansion will compliment some
current product offerings that we have and allow us to further penetrate the aerospace industry. 
We have two (2)  locations in South Bend and one ( 1) 
location in Marion County. We would like
to keep this project and jobs in South Bend. 

Councilmember Regina Williams- Preston asked if they don' t get this abatement are they
considering leaving South Bend. 

Mr. Roland responded that they are considering the South Bend area and just outside of
Indianapolis. 

No one from the public spoke either in favor of or in opposition to the bill.

PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR

Jesse Davis, P.O Box 10205 South Bend IN, stated everyone has probably heard about the
homeless people living under the bridge. Several community members stepped up and provided
tents to give them some type of shelter. Everyone' s goal is to hopefully house these people. 
Some of them might have mental disorders and are incapable of working and some of them are
elderly. Mr. Davis stated he has been down there for months and helping them out. He stated he
has yet to see one ( 1)  single Councilmember until Sunday when Councilmember Williams - 
Preston was down there talking to them. The Mayor doesn' t seem to care either and everyone

16

REGULAR MEETING

SEPTEMBER 26,  2016

seems to want to turn a blind eye.  He stated for him it is personal because he had a brother who
had a mental disability who was homeless until Mr. Davis finally just bought him a home. This is
a huge problem. We don' t have the mental health facilities anymore or the programs we used to
have.  The mental health wards and Madison Center are gone.  This is a serious problem and the
Council should take one ( 1)  of their walking tours down to that bridge and talk with these people. 
We don' t have jobs for them. 

Sharon Banicki, 3822 Ford Street, asked the Council to think long and hard about what they will
do to the lower income people with the increased water rates.  They cannot afford that rate
increase.  We have had so many rate increases lately and everything costs more. Our raises are
not keeping up with all these little fees that are being proposed. Planet Fitness is moving into
Western Avenue and they did it without a tax abatement or coming to this Council and asking for
help.  She asked to the Council to please think long and hard about tax abatements in general. 
Also, Code Enforcement needs education built into their budget so that they know the difference
between wild flowers and weeds. 

ADJOURNMENT

There being no further business to come before the Council, President Tim Scott adjourned the
meeting at 8: 48 p.m.
