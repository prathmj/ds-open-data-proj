Council President Tim Scott — Larry did you see people come and try to take advantage of that
loop hole?  You guys are now closing that loop hole and the special exception to that.  Were there
cases and examples that came before?  Presenter Larry responded there were some examples of
PUD' s that should have gone through the typical zoning procedure.  I am unable to count them, 
but there has been over 30 PUD' s in the city and at least 50%  of them should have gone through
the normal variance procedure or zoning procedure and have been submitted as a planned unit
development,  so this will tighten those up.  Council President Scott stated thank you.

Councilmember Henry Davis, Jr. presented Resolution 15 -75 to the full Council.  Councilmember
Henry Davis, Jr. invited Mr. Hankerson and his teammates with the coaches &  staff, and any family
members to come up.  Councilmember Henry Davis Jr. invited Pastor /Coach Davison to share

some remarks. 

Larry Davison, 25261 Grant Rd., South Bend — I am both Pastor and Coach at Washington High
School for the boys track team.  First I would like to thank Councilmember Henry Davis, Jr. and
the City Council members for this recognition.  We really appreciate you doing this for these young
men.  I would like to say again,  congratulations to John Hankerson for a tremendous job at state, 
as well as to the 4 by 1 relay team.  We had an excellent season this year, we started off by winning

REGULAR MEETING

AUGUST 10,  2015

indoor state in the 4 by 2 relay.  We actually won that, which is the first time that Washington High
School ever did that before.  Then we had a tremendous year sprinting both in the 100,  200, 4 by
1,  and even took the long jump to state this year.  The good thing I like about it, is all of these guys
are coming back next year with one more year left.  We had a young man get injured this year and
believe it or not he' s just as fast as John.  We expected to be faster than what we were last year. 
We not only won the regional championship and the 4 by 1 but we set the regional record.  So
again we appreciate you recognizing us and we appreciate these gentlemen.  They are not only
doing a good job on the track but a good job on the football team and in the classroom as well. 
Colleges are already after these gentlemen.  They have done a tremendous job and we look forward
to them doing a good job this upcoming year.  Please pray for us and we look forward to an exciting
year this upcoming year as well. 

Keith Witherspoon made remarks:  I am Pastor of Bethlehem Baptist Church and a Coach at
Washington High School, any time you put two Baptist preachers together you might go long.  So
I will say everything he said I agree with. 

Councilmember Karen White — I would like to say to Councilmember Davis thank you for bringing

them up early, some pick them up later, you are men who picked them up early.  Keep them with
yourself forever, they will lead you to good places and to good things.  So congratulations. 

Councilmember Dr.  Fred Ferlic —  Congratulations on both your athletic and academic
achievements.  I' m envious you can do both. 

Council President Tim Scott — I agree with everything that has been said up here.  There is one
other thing, I know on this Council there has been back in our day some very good athletes on this
Council.  One thing I took away years later, didn' t realize it when I was your age,  was there are
kids in your grade,  kids younger than you, kids in elementary,  and junior high that are watching
you and paying attention.  I didn' t realize that until a couple of Christmases ago when I went back
and met a younger gentleman who was following me when I was an athlete.  So think about that, 
you are setting a great example and we are very proud of what you have done.  Remember that
other people are watching and following in your footsteps.  Thank you so much,

This being the time heretofore set for the Public Hearing on the above bill, proponents and
opponents were given an opportunity to be heard. 

Those wishing to speak in favor of: 

Samuel Brown, 222 E. Navarre St.,  South Bend— On behalf of Citizens United for a Better
Government I would like to thank these young men for an outstanding job.  I would like to say
this to you guys, you may not understand what you' ve done yet, audio unknown as he was
speaking away from the mic. 

Jesse Davis, P. O.  Box 10205,  South Bend — I just want to say this is a prime example of what we
want to see in our youth and what we should be recognizing here.  These gentlemen behind us
obviously,  strive with that 2.0 GPA and rose above that.  You are a prime example and other
youth are watching you.  We appreciate everything that you do. 

Carl Hubbard,  1922 Piedmont Way, South Bend— I am the girls track coach at Washington High
School, I just want to congratulate these young men.  I do not know what Mr. Brown is talking

NEW BUSINESS
Councilmember Oliver Davis announced that Councilmember Henry Davis,  Jr. will be replacing
him on the MACCOG board and will began for the first meeting on Wednesday.  He will be
sending the notes /letters out via email. 

Councilmember Henry Davis, Jr. reported I have been noticing this for a while, I don' t know
what the pleasure of the council will be, but there has been a lot of shootings and a lot stabbings. 
I don' t know what the stats say about South Bend being safer or more violent. What I do know is
there has been a lot of shootings and a lot of stabbings.  I would like to ask the Health Public
Safety Chair for next council meeting, if possible,  if we can find out solutions for this.  I don' t
know if there is an upswing of crime or not.  I know this past Friday there was a brawl among the
teenagers for those that were attending a beach party on the St. Joe River.  I know that was a one- 
time event, but there are other things that happened during the course ofthe day and during the
week, that I am well aware of too.  To me it just doesn' t sound good, it doesn' t sound safe.  There

was another issue for a local business developer.  He ended up in a situation that was less than
desirable for himself. We have these issues,  we are all aware of them,  if not I would be happy to
fill you in, ( Councilmember Derek Dieter interrupted I am aware of it, do we need to invite the

Police Chief?) Davis continued, whatever we can do.  It is a violent atmosphere out there.  I
don' t want anyone to talk about how violence is down in South Bend because I will tell you
that' s not true.  I' m not interested in talking stats either. I am interested in finding out what
solutions can be put in place to slow this as this is not looking good. 

Councilmember Derek Dieter reported I have been advised that WNIT is showing again a
different Council meeting than the one we are doing right now. 

Council President Tim Scott asked Councilmember Gavin Ferlic and the IT Committee to look
into the issues to see if they can get any resolutions with the broadcasting of the Council
meetings.  Councilmember Gavin Ferlic acknowledged the request.

John Shafer, Chicago &  Michiana Five for the Homeless,  347 W. Lusher Ave, Elkhart, IN — I
want to address the situation of the homelessness in South Bend.  In 2006 the South Bend
Tribune reported that there was approximately 100 unsheltered homeless,  and in 2010 it doubled
to 2009.  In 2011 it had slightly dropped 200 unsheltered homeless.  The Hope Rescue Mission
was established 60 years ago.  Then came a center for the homeless which was bigger and it
became a widely recognized model for the shelters across the country.  It has been around for 26
years.  Hope Ministries formerly Hope Rescue Mission holds 35 men,  16 women, and 18
families with children.  The center as it is widely known holds more than 275 beds,  of which 60

M

REGULAR MEETING

AUGUST 10,  2015

of those beds are for children, that' s 215 beds for adults every night according to their website. 
Lately, the center for the homeless has been full on a daily basis.  That leaves a lot of our
homeless on the streets.  Especially with the Salvation Army Rehab facility closing back in June. 
I' m here to advocate that the city of South Bend needs another homeless shelter or we need to
address the problem with homelessness in South Bend.  Lately, it has become a nightmare for
our city police dealing with drunks, homeless in alleys, and in front of businesses.  Whatever it
takes,  we want to ask that the city addressed the situation with homelessness for our businesses
and for the homeless themselves.  That way we don' t find them sleeping on the streets,  in alleys, 
in abandoned buildings,  and under bridges;  which is where we find many of them as the
organization as that is what we do.  We ask for the welfare of our homeless that we create more
beds in this city, giving them a humane and safe place to sleep at night.  Last week, I found a
gentleman sleeping under a bridge.  It was horrible conditions.  He tried to get in to the center for
the homeless.  He was told the same thing I' m told every day that they' re full.  Due to the staff
reduction of three (3)  personnel, they have recently adjusted their bed count to reflect the loss of
staff of three ( 3)  members.  Hopefully they will get that back up to where they are fully staffed
and open more beds.  We just hope that the city takes a look at this.
