Councilmember Oliver Davis, Chair of the Zoning and Annexation Committee, reported that
they met and send this bill forward with a favorable recommendation. 

Matthew Chappuies, Area Plan Commission with offices on the 11th Floor of the County -City
Building, served as the presenter for this bill. This petition is for a rezoning of property at the
north of the Blackthorn Golf Course.  The petitioner is seeking a special exception as a part of the
petition to maintain the use of the golf course that would be rezoned Community Business
District. The site consists of two (2)  lots and the petitioner is planning to construct a six ( 6)  story
hotel with approximately one hundred and twenty ( 120)  guest rooms. The staff are working on
written commitments to limit uses on the site that would be consistent with the rest of the
Blackthorn Corporate Office Park. This bill comes from the Area Plan Commission with a
favorable recommendation subject to the written commitments. 

Brian McMorrow, Abonmarche Consultants 750 Lincolnway East South Bend on behalf of
Acquisition Group,  served as the petitioner for this bill. The hotel and parking lot will be
designed a little more efficiently than originally thought and that is why the special exception is
needed because we only need about half of the acres we are requesting to rezone. The special
exception is to allow golf to continue even though it will be zoned Community Business. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis asked if they have decided on a brand for the hotel. 

Mr. McMorrow responded no but it will be a marquee name that people will recognize. When
this approval is granted that is when those decisions will be made. 

No one from the public spoke either in favor of or opposition to the bill. 

Councilmember Dr. David Varner made a motion to send Bill 22 -16 to the full Council favorably

Councilmember Gavin Ferlic, Chair of the Community Investment Committee,  reported they met
and send this bill forward with a favorable recommendation. 

Aaron Kobb, Community Investment with offices on the 14th Floor, served as the presenter of
this bill. The tax abatement referenced in this resolution was adopted on September 22nd 2014. 
The original private investment and jobs numbers have both been met and exceded. 

Anne Fischesser, attorney with Faegre Baker Daniels 202 S.  Michigan Street,  served as the
petitioner for this bill. The request is for a waiver of non - compliance in regards to the tax
abatement regarding the filing of the application for deduction. The application was to be filed
thirty (30)  days after receipt of the notice of assessment. The company, Run- Faster -Run, has
stated that to the best of their knowledge they never received the notice of assessment and did
not think it was that unusual as property was owned by the City as of March 1 st 2015.  When they
received the tax bill they immediately filed the application for deduction and also paid the tax
bill and are now requesting a waiver of non - compliance so the tax abatement can be effective for
the 2015 tax year.  The orginal commitment was for one $ 1, 000, 000 and Run - Faster -Run spent
over $2, 500,000 on the project. Originally it was only three ( 3)  jobs pledged but sixteen ( 16) jobs
now are present. 

Joe Hart, 501 West South Street and President of South Bend Cubs,  confirmed they did not
receive the paperwork for this and once we got the tax bill we paid everything and then began
this process.

Councilmember Gavin Ferlic made a motion to adopt Bill 16 -47.  Councilmember Karen White

Councilmember Randy Kelly announced the Mom' s Against Violence Remembrance and
Awareness Walk is this Saturday at 9: 30 a.m. at Robinson Community Learning Center and will

PRIVILEDGE OF THE FLOOR

Jesse Davis, P. O.  Box 10205 South Bend IN, stated he has submitted multiple privilege of the
floors requests and has not heard anything back. There are some very important questions he has
and does a lot of research before submitting these.  He submitted new requests to the City Clerk' s
Office which includes all prior requests outstanding. 

Samuel Brown, 222 East Navarre Street, there needs to be more street crime units in the police. 
They are understaffed and underfunded even though they do such a great job. As it is getting
warmer there will be more crime like always and these units need our support. 

Elder Dennis Plump, 302 South Chicago Street, stated the Council needs to care more about all
of their residents.  We need equality for all people no matter of color or sex. It is a sad thing that
at some of these Council Meetings there is no equality and some people are treated differently
because of who they know or what demographic area they live in. Its easy to see the millions of
dollars spent in the Smart Streets project but the inner city population has to accept the low
standards of improvement. We just want our equal share of the pie. We are tired of the crime and
the bones thrown to our community. We are going to hold this elected body accountable for their
actions and that includes the mayor. 

Marvin Creighton, 305 South Lake Street, reiterated Mr. Plum' s sentiments. Everyone knows
about all the killings and shootings going on in the neighborhoods.  Code Enforcement has not
done a good job keeping our neighborhoods clean. We need to take care of the drug problem in
this City as well. We need more police protection as well and need to do better. 

Jason Baniki Critchlow, 3822 West Ford Street, stated last year we raised fines for the tall grass
ordinance. Now here on some of these vacant lots we have grass that is knee high already. There
was this plan to tear down a thousand houses in a thousand days but there was no plan on what to
deal with the properties now that they are empty. These high fines are not changing the behavior

of these people. We need to get with Code Enforcement to decide how we are going to cut this

grass. 

ADJOURNMENT

There being no further business to come before the Council, President Tim Scott adjourned the
meeting at 8: 02 p.m.
