COMMONLY KNOWN AS 6741 LUTZ DRIVE, 
SOUTH BEND, IN 46614 AS A
RESIDENTIALLY DISTRESSED AREA FOR

PURPOSES OF A (5)  FIVE -YEAR

RESIDENTIAL REAL PROPERTY TAX

ABATEMENT FOR JEFFREY SZALAY AND

AMBER O' BRIEN

Councilmember Gavin Ferlic, Chairperson, reported that the Community Investment Committee
met and sends this to the full Council with no recommendation due to time constraints during
their meeting. 

Brock Zeeb,  offices on the 14th Floor of the County -City Building, served as the presenter for
this bill. Mr. Zeeb reported the petitioners intend to build a roughly $185, 000.00 home. The taxes
to be created are estimated at approximately $8, 900.00, the estimated taxes to be abated are
8, 800. 00 and the taxes to be paid are roughly $100. 00. Mr. Zeeb reported the petitioner is here

as well. 

Amber Obrien,  722 S.  Gladstone Ave, is the petitioner of this bill. She stated they are planning
on building the house in Lafayette Falls on the South Side of South Bend and although it is a
newer neighborhood the company went bankrupt and has left around forty (40)  lots vacant. This
has caused the overall price of the houses in the area to decrease.

REGULAR MEETING

JANUARY 25,  2016

Councilmember Karen White thanked Mr. Zeeb for responding to her questions and stated it
might be beneficial to share the question and answer with the Council. 

Mr. Zeeb reported the question Councilmember White had was the process related to residential
tax abatements.  Mr. Zeeb stated often they can be confused with commercial abatements since
the process is very similar but it is not identical.  If a property is residential it has certain specific
requirements and that is why the ordinance the Council passes mentions the specific lot and
determines it as residentially distressed. 

Council Attorney Cekanski - Farrand added the petitioners complete a form that explains why it is
economically distressed and the situation regarding the bankruptcy of Lafayette Falls did qualify
the lot to meet those requirements. 

Council Vice President Davis asked if the bankruptcy had not occurred then you may not have
determined it as residentially distressed. 

Mr. Zeeb responded yes that it correct. He stated one of the things that Community Investment
has done working with the Council and Clerks Office, for example regarding the Triangle
Neighborhood and up near Notre Dame may qualify for residentially distressed through
discussions they have identified areas where they would not take those abatements. We did go
down to the lot and see what we are looking for such as a high frequency of empty lots that have
remained empty for a long period of time. He stated this does change over time and as the
neighborhood rebounds we will issue less to that neighborhood. 

Councilmember Williams Preston asked what the four bullet points are that you referenced about
the qualifications on what is a residentially distressed area. 

Mr. Zeeb responded that he will send them to her as they are rather lengthy and he would be
doing a disservice trying to quote them off hand at the moment. 

Councilmember Williams Preston stated she is asking because she is also curious about the
language residentially distressed because she drove down there and thought it was a beautiful
neighborhood and it didn' t seem distressed me.  She stated now that she heard his answers she
can see where they are coming from and she stated she is glad that it sounds like they are not
doing this because they have always done it this way. She also stated she may think other people
who are not privy to these different codes may not understand but thinks going forward so
everyone knows about the opportunity abatements can have especially in my district. She stated
she simply wanted to take the moment to make sure we are getting this information out to the
public and extend these wonderful opportunities. 

Councilmember Dr. Varner stated the commercial abatements rarely exceeded a fifty percent
abatement. He stated this is the first time he has heard it being almost one hundred percent. He
asked if there is anyway going forward to cap an abatement say at fifty percent. 

Council Attorney Cekanski- Farrand responded not unless you amended the city code. 

Councilmember Dr. Varner stated he never thought anyone would think it would be one hundred
percent over a five year period. He stated he is not saying this for the current bill but going
forward for future abatements. 

Mr. Zeeb responded typically there is a sweet spot in residential abatements and it really depends
on how much the house costs and in this instance since the assessed value was low enough it
qualified for this much. He stated first movers are typically given the highest abatements and
then those who come after in a neighborhood are given less. 

Councilmember Dr. Varner responded thank you for the clarification and maybe this should be
looked at going forward. 

There was no one from the public wishing to speak in favor or against the bill. 

Councilmember Dr. Varner made a motion for the adoption of the resolution. Councilmember
Oliver Davis seconded the motion which carried. The resolution passed by a roll call vote of nine
9)  ayes.

PRIVILEDGE OF THE FLOOR

Jesse Davis, P. O.  Box 10205 South Bend,  stated he has come many times discussing city
vehicles being used during personal time. He stated while he was taking photos of Elbel Park he
saw truck #205,  which he stated has been seen several times at a local bar and is seen here at the
bar owner' s house. He gave the Council the photos. He also asked the Council how many
investigations have been levied against the City in the last two years whether Federal,  Local, or
State and how many are ongoing. He asked the City if there have been any accidents reported
during September while there was a demolition of a house on Lake St. and if they are still getting
contracts with the city while they are suing the city. 

REGULAR MEETING

JANUARY 25,  2016

Jason Banicki Critchlow, 3822 W Ford St South Bend, stated that its kind of early talking
budgets and funding but he was already seen a new restaurant tax to fund the zoo and then also
selling Elbel. He stated this bothers him and everyone knows the gas tax is going to go up soon
just as the wheel tax will go up. He stated at some point we will have to stop taxing everyone in
this city to the breaking point and if the zoo if something they want and enjoy they need to spend
the money at the zoo and not count on a special tax just for the zoo.  He stated it would inevitably
be raised to start spending money on other things.  He stated ifwe really need this tax lets at least
do a full one percent tax not one quarter of one percent. He stated lets save Elbel and make sure
this tax is not for one person. He stated you cannot say the zoo is special and then subsequently
sell Elbel and twenty five percent of our park land. 

Paul Blaschko,  322 E. Colfax South Bend, stated he was representing Elbel for Everyone. He
asked everyone in attendance to raise their hands for being here to save Elbel.  He encouraged the
Council to continue to listen to the voices beginning to be heard and said that this city has a
vision to invest in our parks and natural spaces. 

Jerry Niezgodski,  1113 N. Eliot, welcomed the new and returning Council members this year
and voiced his support in not selling Elbel Park. He stated whether we keep it or sell it the area
should remain a Golf Course. He stated back when they first made that course the country club
wanted to swap with them and moving forward he would like to see some comparisons to other
municipalities. He stated Mr. Berlin has shown that marketing can achieve wonders in our city
and that may solve the budgeting problems. 

Katherine Osborne,  517 River Ave South Bend, stated she is a new comer to this city and from
her perspective one of the great things about South Bend is the investment the city has made in
green spaces and parks.  She stated she would hate to see Elbel go and in fact it could be made
more attractive and accessible to residents.  She stated that if we sell it for not very much money
there is no take backs once it' s sold it' s gone. 

Jennifer Betz,  511 S.  St. Joseph St, had a woman submit her name and address who could not
make it because she is in cancer treatment and she read her statement. Her name is Connie
Tooley, 514 W. Lasalle Ave, who wrote " I can' t make the hearings but want my voice to be
heard.  I recently had surgery related to breast cancer and have therapy today at 2 p.m. which
takes two hours and takes the stuffing out of me. I did sign the petition and have been following
the news. I definitely want to say to the powers that be to hear our pleas and give the citizens a
say and a chance to come up with a viable alternative. We need to save what we have, to take
care of what we have and to acquire more parks and green space,  not sell an environmental gem
such as Elbel. They owe us that much and this my way or the highway attitude has demolished
too many things of value in this town just look at the history of what DTSB used to look like." 

Rebecca Oneil,  518 S.  St. Joseph St.,  stated she is a recent graduate of St. Mary' s and has moved
into a community that had its voices heard today. She stated she worked with a nonprofit that
works with local urban youth and wants to echo that benefits for the urban youth should not be
pitted against the parks or park initiatives. 

Charles Smith, 2023 S.  Haley St,  stated he was not here to speak about Elbel. He stated he has
spent time with the people who work with the City and is here to speak on behalf of the animal
community in South Bend. He stated animal welfare does have an impact on our community. He
stated he is here to let the Council know the animal community is making things happen in South
Bend from working at shelters to helping adoption rates. He stated Pit Bull South Bend has
brought change and a new ordinance which is one of the best things South Bend has done for the
animal community. He stated he invited Mayor Pete and he did not respond. He stated we are
here to make a better and safer community as a whole. 

ADJOURNMENT

There being no further business to come before the Council, President Tim Scott adjourned the
meeting at 8: 15 p.m.
