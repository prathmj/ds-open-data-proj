PUBLIC HEARING ON AN ORDINANCE

AMENDING THE ZONING ORDINANCE FOR

PROPERTY LOCATED AT 803 WEST

WASHINGTON STREET,  COUNCILMANIC

DISTRICT NO.  1 IN THE CITY OF SOUTH

BEND, INDIANA

Councilmember Oliver Davis,  Chair of the Zoning and Annexation Committee, reported that
they met and send this bill forward with a favorable recommendation. 

Councilmember Karen White made a motion to accept the substitute bill on file in the City
Clerk' s Office. Councilmember Oliver Davis seconded the motion which carried by a voice nine
9)  ayes. 

Councilmember Karen White made a motion to amend Substitute Bill 21 - 16 by changing current
section two (2)  to become three ( 3).  The new section two (2)  will read " This ordinance is subject
to the execution and recording of written commitments set forth in Exhibit A which is attached
hereto and included herein by reference."  Councilmember John Voorde seconded the motion
which carried by a voice vote of nine ( 9)  ayes. 

Matthew Chappuies, Area Plan Commission with office on the 11th Floor of the County -City
Building, served as the presenter for this bill. This is the property commonly known as the
Kizer House ". The petition was brought by the Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana
seeking a rezoning of the property from Multi- Family District to Mixed -Use District. Mr. 
Chappuies provided photos and plans of the site for the Council which are on file in the City
Clerk' s Office. The building is currently undergoing very extensive interior and exterior
renovations. The existing curb cuts on Washington Street will be eliminated in exchange for a
new curb cut located on MLK Drive. The petition for the curb cut was approved by the
Department of Public Works. There are also written commitments that address the maximum

number of residential units on the property and require that the property maintain an agreement
with the History Museum which would allow for overflow parking if needed. The Area Plan
Commission sends this bill forward to the full Council with a favorable recommendation. 

Gregory A. Kil, Kil Architectural Planning with studios located at 1126 Lincolnway East South
Bend, spoke as the petitioner for this bill. Their office put together the site plan as well as the
petition for the curb cut. At the last committee meeting, Engineering requested a traffic study and
they did perform that study and submitted it per their request. Mr. Kil provided documents with
the councilmembers that demonstrate the site lines for vehicles. In addition to making the access
to the property safer with the new curb cuts they are eliminating unsafe curb cuts on Washington
Street. 

Todd Zeiger, Director of the Northern Regional Office of the Indiana Landmarks Foundation
with addresses at 402 West Washington South Bend, also spoke as a petitioner for this bill. Their
goal for this property is to restore the area in front of the building to green space since it is
currently all concrete and doesn' t fit in with the neighborhood. With parking in the rear of the
property, the home will fit much better than it has for many decades.  Their offices will be
relocated to this site and the upstairs will be used as apartments. 

There were no questions from the Council.

REGULAR MEETING

JUNE 13,  2016

Those from the public wishing to speak in favor of the bill: 

Noreen Dean - Moran, President of the Near Northwest Neighborhood Association, at their
previous neighborhood meeting they voted unanimously in favor of this bill. They received very
detailed plans from the petitioners and are satisfied with their parking solutions. This will be an
appropriate building for our National Historic District Neighborhood. 

Elicia Feasel,  Executive Director of the Historic Preservation Commission with offices at 125
South Lafayette Boulevard, stated the Commission is currently undergoing the process to have
the building designated as a local historic landmark. That is based on its significance historically
and architecturally. A rezoning to a Mixed -Use District will not pose any conflict with the
Historic District zoning overlay. This project will be beneficial to the property and the

neighborhood. 

Andrew Ujdak,  121 South Chapin Street South Bend 46601,  spoke in favor of the bill. The
petitioners have relieved both of these concerns regarding parking and limitation of residential
dwelling units. This used to be a problem property and now it is headed to a much brighter
future. All concerns have been addressed that he has regarding the plan. There is a lot of work to
do on this building and it will be great to see it completed. 

Jim Bognar,  807 West Washington Street, spoke in support of the bill. He has lived near the
property for over fifty (50)  years and it is great that Landmarks has decided to be a good steward
of the property. They have answered issues of the curb cut and limiting apartments. Their
intention is to return this house to the condition that Mr. Kizer would have wanted. It will be a
big positive for the neighborhood. There have been local jobs working on this project which is
great to see.  Mr. Bognar thanked the Council for their receptiveness to his concerns as well as
the County Council as well. The preservation of our history is something we can all be proud of
and seek to do. 

Those wishing to speak in opposition to the bill: 

Philip Blain, 739 West Washington Street, spoke against the bill. Everything they are talking
about is great and he loves it but he is the one directly affected by the state of this property. The
only information he has gotten is what he had to pull out of their hands. They are hiding behind
lock doors and holding this information. Yes this will be a benefit in the long run and he is
excited to see how this plays out but they should not get preferential treatment. 

Mr. Zeiger was given the opportunity for a rebuttal. He stated that he did meet with Mr. Blain
this afternoon after the Committee meeting to address his concerns and clean up the construction
work in the morning and move the outdoor restroom facilities. Their door was locked because it
was after 5: 00 p.m. They met and talked for a half hour and he did his best to address his

concerns. 

Councilmember Tim Scott thanked everyone who has worked on this bill so far as this is in his
district. There has been a lot of great communication and collaboration with all the individual
parties involved. 

Councilmember John Voorde made a motion to send the substitute bill as amended to the full
Council with a favorable recommendation. Councilmember Oliver Davis seconded the motion
which carried by voice vote of nine (9)  ayes. 

RISE AND REPORT

Councilmember Oliver Davis made a motion to rise and report to full Council.  Councilmember
Karen White seconded the motion which carried by a voice vote of nine (9)  ayes.

few years and want to do it within the proper requirements.

years and when applying for a tent permit this year they discovered they were in violation of the

NEW BUSINESS

Councilmember Oliver Davis requested. that Eric Horvath, Director of Public Works, speak to
the Public Works and Property Vacation Committee on June 27th 2016 regarding the sidewalks
program. 

Council President Tim Scott announced that he and the presidents of the Mishawaka Common
Council and St. Joseph County Council agreed to three ( 3)  meetings regarding the food and
beverage tax resolutions all three ( 3)  councils adopted. Those meetings are scheduled for June
29th,  July 27th and August 31 St and will take place at the Century Center. The idea is to present
information on food and beverage taxes and receive input and feedback from the various
councilmembers and from the public. 

Councilmember Karen White announced the budget hearing process is beginning. The schedule
is online and there are seven ( 7)  public hearings beings hosted here and also one ( 1)  meeting out
in the community. The date for the community meeting will be set hopefully by next week. 
Those will start in August and go through September. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis announced the new bus shelters are being built and there are more
to come as well. He asked any councilmembers to notify him if they have areas in their districts
that need the bus shelters.  These are needed for people during the winter when it snows and also
when it rains. 

PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR

Jesse Davis,  210 Towle Ave Mishawaka Indiana, stated the people who spoke at the podium
earlier in the meeting disobeyed the rules by not stating their residential address.  They only gave
their office addresses.  If the public has to play by the rules everyone else should as well. Mr. 
Davis voiced his opposition to the removal of the " Privilege of the Floor Letterform ". That is the
citizens'  only tool to document a paper trail of what we are upset about and the only way to
submit any type of evidence to the City. When that form was submitted with evidence it was
entered into public record which is important. We can' t go online and find half the minutes and
then minutes only go so far because they are just the outline of what someone might have said on
an issue.  Without the form there is no way to officially submit something to the Council. This is
taking the public' s voice away. Mr. Davis stated there was large party at the J. C. Lauber
Building. Apparently that building is owned by a relative of Aaron Perri and people are
concerned because people were drinking along with South Bend Brew Works was there and had
a food truck parked inside the building and had a cover charge for people. The building is not
permitted properly and the building has not been inspected and it needs to be looked into. 

Bill Dunn,  1620 Southwood Avenue South Bend, spoke in favor of the proposal to build a
firehouse at the southwest corner of Potawatomi Park. Mr. Dunn is a member of the Board of
Directors of the River Park Neighborhood Association but he is speaking as a citizen tonight
who lives very close to the zoo. According to the petition against the firehous6,  locating the
firehouse would disrupt park activities ranging from the pavilion to the swimming pool and
King' s Kingdom when the sirens would go off for an emergency call. The petition also states the
noise level would cause potential harm to children. What is not mentioned in the petition is that
the most common route today for fire trucks and ambulances in River Park is Mishawaka Ave
with sirens sounding and horns honking the entire time. That is approximately twenty -five (25) 
foot distance from the proposed site of the new firehouse. What is also not mentioned is that
sound levels and decibels decrease with the hearers distance from the source.  Unless someone
would be standing right by the fire truck they are not going to be hearing those high decibel

REGULAR MEETING

JUNE 13,  2016

levels. Regardless of where the firehouse is to be located, the vehicles will be transiting the
school areas no matter what and it does not matter where the firehouse is located. 

Ronnie Seward, 703 Kentucky Street South Bend, spoke in favor of the need for better sidewalk
programs specifically highlighting the need for new sidewalks and curbs on Kentucky Street. and
Chapin Street. There are many areas in the South Bend communities who need help fixing these
sidewalks not just the main thoroughfares.  People just want simple fixes while the City is paying
for large upgrades to the roads. 

Samuel Brown, 222 East Navarre Street South Bend, spoke in admiration of Muhammad Ali and
the work he did for South Bend and was a great person every time he came to this City. Mr. 
Brown expressed the need of the community to come together and get past racial and other
differences that separate the community. The only way that violence is going to change is if we
come together and say enough is enough. 

Jonathan Anderstrom, 526 W. Western Avenue, stated the City needs to work with businesses
for their new free Wi -Fi downtown. It is a great thing for the city to have but we need to make
sure it is not disparately affecting other businesses'  downtown Wi -Fi. This is a great program but
the City does need to discuss with businesses before implementing such a powerful network
because it does have unintended consequences. Mr. Anderstrom spoke about the proposed
charter school to come downtown and stated they have pulled the application for right now but
do intend to submit a new application in the future. 

Jean Perrin, 830 South 32" d Street South Bend 46615,  president of the River Park Neighborhood
Association but spoke as a citizen.. Ms. Perrin spoke in favor of the proposed relocation of the
River Park Fire Station. Due to the realities of the City' s Budget this proposal makes the most
fiscal sense.  There is also an urgency to have a fire station with an ambulance in the
neighborhood. Ms. Perrin spoke about the difficulties her family had when her husband had to
wait for twenty (20)  minutes for an ambulance because of the great distance they have to travel
to get to River Park. The EMTs and firefighters who responded were wonderful and resuscitated
her husband but no one should go through that trauma or fear. Also, the proposed relocation is
equidistant to the boundaries of River Park and there would be a positive presence in the park
that could possibly help mitigate possible criminal issues. 

Huey Scoby, 3415 Riverside Drive South Bend, spoke in support of establishing a MLK Drive in
South Bend. He has submitted petitions with over seven - hundred (700)  signatures asking to
move MLK Drive to a larger road and over sixteen ( 16)  pastors are in agreement as well. This
town is heading towards being another Fergusson Missouri if we do not change how we operate. 
The Council should look at those petitions and let the community decide which street. 

Janet Maciulski,  1117 South 31st South Bend, spoke in favor of Potawatomi Park and stopping
the proposed firehouse.  She presented a petition with over seven - hundred and fifty (750) 
signatures from all over the country.  Some of these signers have enjoyed growing the park while
growing up in South Bend and others are friends and relatives of residents who enjoy the park
while.visiting the City. They are submitting responses from South Bend residents only. Their
words represent the breadth and depth of the overall opposition to the firehouse. Ms. Maciulski
also turned in over four hundred ( 400)  written petitions as well.  Ms. Maciulski read a few of the
responses from people who were against building the firehouse. 

Pam Claeys,  1106 Bellevue South Bend 46615,  stated she is a part of the River Park
Neighborhood Association but is speaking against the proposed firehouse.  Ms. Claeyes provided
a map of the parks in South Bend and Potawatomi is the only park in River Park. She suggested
buying houses on Mishawaka Street that are for sale and use that land for the firehouse. Green
space is invaluable to the City. 

Linda Myers, 2823 Samsong Street South Bend 46614, spoke about the benefit of nature to
living a healthy life. Some doctors even prescribe patients to spend time in nature. In our
technological world today we need parks and green space more than ever. Protecting nature
builds upon our community and makes us all healthier. South Bend can be an even better place to
live and building that firehouse is a step backwards. 

M

REGULAR MEETING

JUNE 13,  2016

Carol Schumaker,  1613 Hildreth Street South Bend 46615,  spoke against the proposed firehouse. 
She stated she has called an ambulance and they arrived in a timely fashion and she has no
problem with the Fire Department. However, the park is heavily used by the community in that
area and many of the houses do not have large yards. These homes are middle and working class
people who cannot afford houses with big yards. The park allows the people of River Park to
have green space for their children. Childhood obesity is a huge problem in this country and
access to parkland is the solution. When we lose parkland the people that suffer the most are low
and middle income families. 

Rich Wallace, 937 South 21St South Bend 46615,  spoke against the proposed firehouse. 
Potawatomi is a passive park which has value in and of itself. South Bend is underrepresented in
green space and taking even more away doesn' t make any sense.  For children in the
neighborhood that area is the main access to Kids Kingdom, the pool and the zoo.  If the
firehouse was built there it would be a concern for the students who go to John Adams because it
is so congested. 

Bradley Laird, 1232 Longfellow Avenue South Bend 46615,  spoke against the proposed
firehouse. We want and need good Fire Department service and an ambulance based in the
neighborhood but it is a profound failure of imagination to devalue our natural spaces.  We can' t
and should not let go of our natural spaces because once we lose them they are gone for good. 
Every person that drives past that park sees open green space which has a positive effect on their
wellbeing. This is a jewel in our community and we should protect it. Mr. Laird acknowledged
the constraints that the state government has placed on local governments in the form of revenue. 

ADJOURNMENT

There being no further business to come before the Council, President Tim Scott adjourned the
meeting at 8: 13 p.m.
