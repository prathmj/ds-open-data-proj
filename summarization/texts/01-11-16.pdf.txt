let the administration present their reasoning for wishing to sell the golf course and allow the
Council to ask them their questions regarding the sale.  He also asked his fellow Councilmembers
to send Randy Kelly, Parks Chairperson, those specific questions by January 18th,  2016. He also
asked that the second public meeting after that be somewhere in the 1St Council District. 

Councilmember Randy Kelly responded that he would do just that and stated since we are
moving the Public Hearing to February 8th,  2016 we can have Community Investment come and
present their case to the Parks Committee on January 25th,  2016 and ask for public input on the
matter at that time as well. 

Council President Tim Scott reported that at the last Council Meeting the Council requested that
a letter be sent to the Superintendent of South Bend School Corporation as well as the President
of the School Corporation asking for the Council to have a representative on the search
committee which will select the next Superintendent of South Bend School Corporation. Mr. 
Scott stated they did send that letter and are waiting for a reply. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis asked if all of the contact information for the Councilmember has
been updated. Kareemah Fowler reported yes they have been.  Councilmember Oliver Davis said
then he encourages the public to get that contact information from the Clerk' s Office and email
the Councilmembers any questions about the Elbel sale they may have to allow the
Councilmembers more time to do their homework regarding this issue and be more prepared for
those future meeting. 

Councilmember Gavin Ferlic wanted the let the public know that the Parks Committee meeting
on January 25th,  2016 will start approximately between 3: 30 P. M. and 5: 30 P. M. and will not be
the full Council meeting at 7: 00 P. M. that night. He also wanted to reiterate that will not be the
only opportunity for public input on the issue in addition to the full Council meeting on February
8th,  2016. 

Council President Scott said hopefully the Parks Committee hearing will be placed on the back
end of that time frame close to 5: 00 P. M. so more members of the public are available to come. 

Councilmember Randy Kelly said that time will be published ahead of time as well.

resolution regarding the burial site of Schuyler Colfax to bring the site up to the standard of

development by the Heritage Fund. He stated the Council' s part to play in that development has

already happened but he encouraged people to contact him before the meeting before hand for
any questions they may have. 

PRIVILEDGE OF THE FLOOR

Jesse Davis,  P. O Box 10205 South Bend IN, welcomed the new Councilmembers and voiced his
support for tiny houses which he thinks is an affordable housing option in South Bend. He also
reported he- has heard much discussion about tiny houses being a solution for the homeless and
that he will be back numerous times regarding this issue and hopefully change some of the
ordinances or zoning issues that are stopping the development of these tiny houses. 

Samuel Brown, 222 East Navarre St.,  South Bend, welcomed the new Councilmembers and gave
a brief update on the MLK street renaming project. He stated it is going a little slower than he
wanted but it is going to get done. He reported they are doing a lot of research before the project
gets done but on his end he doesn' t understand the people who don' t see the importance of
naming a street after Martin Luther King because his record speaks for itself. 

Nicki Stillson, 62555 Poppy Rd. South Bend, spoke in support of the tiny house program and is
one of the founding members of Michiana Tiny House Enthusiasts. She wanted to make the
Council aware of the growing desire for tiny houses, both mobile and permanent, in South Bend. 
She wants the Council to amend the code and ordinances to allow for tiny houses.  She gave
multiple benefits of tiny houses including attracting a wide range of people not just millennials
but also the retirement population, filling vacant lots in South Bend and lots that are too small for
normal houses,  and helping South Bend become a city looking towards the future.  She reported
other cities across the nation have already made this work and it can be done. 

April Lidinsky, 536 S.  Sunnyside Ave South Bend, she wished to thank everyone on the Council
for their service and expressed her excitement for the new faces on the Council. She also came in
support of the tiny house movement as she teaches about them at IUSB.  She stated she thinks
tiny houses can help move South Bend forward and thinks a good idea is doing a pilot program
for tiny houses downtown so people can see what they look like and how they work. 

Anna Shirk, 33415 Pleasant St.  South Bend, spoke in support of tiny houses and how they
promote smart sustainable living. She thinks ordinances currently make it very difficult to own a
tiny house. Tiny houses can help millennials have affordable housing and deal with the vacant lot
problem at the same time in addition with the homelessness problem. She spoke also about the
environmental benefits that tiny houses bring. She asked the Councilmembers to please exchange
contact information with her after the meeting. 

Jennifer Betts,  511 S.  St. Joseph St.  South Bend, welcomed the new Council to 2016 and thinks
this can be a great year for new and engaging ideas to come to South Bend such as tiny houses
but other wonderful ideas as well. 

Margaret Pfeil,  511 S.  St. Joseph St.  South Bend, wanted to welcome the new Council and stated
from the standpoint of social ethics the parks in this area helps reduce violence. She stated
studies have shown residents having access to green space helps reduce violence and should not
be viewed in a purely economic framework. 

Andrew Tucker,  127 S.  34`" Street South Bend,  stated he works as an ecologist at a nonprofit in
South Bend. He wanted to express his thoughts on how the city can work with natural areas.  The
first is public ownership and maintenance which can be achieved with working with nonprofits
and local universities. A second model is partnership with a land trust with experience in
supporting natural areas.  Although land trust and private entities they operate in ways that
promote the public good such as maintaining trails and other community positives. He stated
these models help engage citizens and keep them in their communities. 

Kristi Haas, 3808 Clydesdale Dr., wanted to reiterate the idea that natural areas supported by the
city provide more than simple financial value to the city.
