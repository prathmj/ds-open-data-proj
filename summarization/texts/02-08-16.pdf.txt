SPECIAL BUSINESS

Council President Tim Scott announced Bills 05 -16 and 16 -16 will be continued to
February 22nd 2016. 

MAYOR' S ANNUAL ADDRESS TO THE COMMON COUNCIL ON FINANCES AND THE

GENERAL CONDITION OF THE CITY PURSUANT TO ยง 2 -3. 1 OF THE SOUTH BEND

MUNCIPAL CODE

Mayor Pete Buttigieg gave an address to the City Council on the state of the City' s finances. 
There will be a more general State of the City address on February 23rd 2016 at IUSB. 

In 2015 the City had total expenditures of $293, 505, 690 dollars. The General Fund revenue, 
supported by property tax dollars for " ordinary"  city businesses,  came in slightly higher by about
one million dollars than was anticipated. The Enterprise Funds came in a bit lower which was
expected as the City did not issue a bond last year. For the foreseeable future there will be more
redevelopment projects than we can finance, which is a good problem to have as it points to a

REGULAR MEETING

February 81",  2016

growing economy, but still presents challenges. Internal Service Funds are a category of
expenditures to keep an eye on as that includes the cost of health care. There has been a leveling
off the past two years but that is mainly due to the City losing the Zoo employees and the 911
employees.  Health care per employee is still rising. The new Healthcare Clinic, recently opened, 
is designed to help get those healthcare costs under control. Since the City is self - insured even
one or two major healthcare issues can be noticeable and hopefully this clinic will help catch
those large cases early on. 

The single biggest revenue stream of the total $290,000,000 is charges for services, making up
around twenty -nine percent ( 29 %). These are water, sewer, and trash fees for the most part. 
Property taxes, the single biggest tax the city collects, stood around twenty -five percent ( 25 %). 
Local income taxes are growing in importance to the overall city budget. The bulk of
expenditures is on Utilities and Public Safety. 

Regarding the General Fund specifically, which the City has more discretion over how funds are
allocated, the vast majority is going to Public Safety. These funds are almost totally raised by
property taxes so they are very hard to replace. 

In 2020 the State' s final property tax cap, of which the large portion happened in 2008 and 2009, 
will kick in. The estimated loss in General Fund revenue is $2. 54 million dollars. The estimated
Parks &  Recreation loss is $ 510,000. 00.  The estimated TIF Funds loss is $ 3. 8 million. 

Local income taxes have become more important in the overall make up of revenue for the city. 
The total of the local option income taxes in South Bend is 1. 75 %, the state max for local option
income taxes is 2 %. 

South Bend has very high cash reserves at over 50%  of expenditures. This is very high for a city
our size and one of the highest in the state.  In per capita outstanding debt South Bend is in a
decent position, around the middle compared to other comparable Indiana cities. This is true for
long -term debt as well. 

The city had 1, 069 employees last year which is down over the past years because the Zoo and
911 were taken off the city books. Taking into account those losses,  the City has remained steady
after the big drop off in 2008 and 2009. A majority of full time employees are in Public Safety
and the next largest is Public Works. Parks &  Rec. had eighty -eight ( 88)  full time employees,  of
course that does not account for the many part time and season employees they hire over the

summer months. 

South Bend has an AA bond rating which has saved tax payers millions over recent years as the
City qualifies for lower interest rates. Looking at the top five (5)  second -class cities in Indiana, 
four of the top five (5)  are wealthy Indianapolis suburbs and then relative lower income South
Bend as number three ( 3).  This is a credit to successive Administrations and Councils who have
kept the City in good financial shape. 

South Bend received the Distinguished Budget Presentation Award and the Certificate of
Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting.  Fishers is the only other city in the state of
Indiana who received both of those awards this year. 

The Mayor provided a link to all available financial reports. The entire budget down to the dollar
is available online. In addition to that, the City also has opened up our checkbook and put that
online as well, which is not required by law. This allows specific expenditures to be available to
the public and interested parties. The City is also looking into populating a Popular Financial
Report as well to be more user friendly for the average citizen. 

Each Councilmember was given the opportunity to ask the Mayor three questions. 

Councilmember Dr. Varner asked if the potential shortfalls factored in any growth. 

The Mayor responded the City selected a middle ground for growth of one ( 1)  to two (2)  percent
for these projections. 

Councilmember Dr. Varner asked if we have seen net assessment growth from the millions of
dollars spent on redevelopment over the past few years. 

REGULAR MEETING

February 8t",  2016

The Mayor responded there is a payback period that is intended in those agreements. The City is
now coming up to the point where we can look if we met those benchmarks that were planned

out. 

Councilmember Karen White asked if the total of all those economic setbacks by the property
tax was over $6. 5 million. The Mayor responded yes it is much larger than just the General Fund
setback.  Councilmember Karen White agreed with the Mayor that we need to start addressing
those setbacks in this budget. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis. stated during the last property tax cutbacks we had experts come in
to analyze the numbers and give presentations to the Council, he asked when the Council could
expect to see something similar from this Administration. He also asked if the Mayor believes
there are any proposals in the Statehouse that may roll back these reductions. 

The Mayor responded every year a few property tax reform bills are proposed but none of them
are likely to succeed and they are very small compared to the property tax cutbacks of 2008 and
2009.  The Mayor expressed that the current makeup of the Statehouse does not seem willing to
provide relief in property taxes.  The Administration would be happy to set up meetings between
the financial analysts as they update these numbers with the Council. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis asked if changing or reducing the Cities TIF areas may help

provide some relief. 

The Mayor said changing TIF funds has pros and cons.  The benefit is you are still keeping the
funds in the City. The downside is you really only get pennies on the dollar back to the General
Fund. While TIF areas do make up a large portion of the physical area of the City they do not
make up that high of a percentage based on assessed value. The Mayor agreed that creative
solutions need to be looked at to address these issues and the Councilmembers who worked
through those 2008 and 2009 cutbacks, their expertise will be needed. 

Councilmember Randy Kelly asked if anyone is seriously looking at changing to a land value
taxation value in the Statehouse. 

The Mayor responded he has not heard of anything towards that goal but would get back with
Councilmember Randy Kelly if he did. 

Councilmember Jo M. Broden thanked the Mayor and the finance team who continue to win
these awards and thanked the City as a whole for developing the Healthcare Clinic. 

Councilmember John Voorde complimented the financial team and believes more financial
information is available to the public easily than has ever been. 

Council President Tim Scott asked if the Parks &  Rec figures were not including the bonds. 

The Mayor responded yes these are just cash flow accounts. 

Council President Scott asked if the Health Clinic has all employee buy in and if there is a
projected offset in the coming years. 

The Mayor said they have no projections at the moment but they do think it will save a good
amount of money in the future since the City is self - insured. 

Council President Tim Scott asked if someone would give a presentation to the Health and
Public Safety Committee regarding the clinic. The Mayor responded yes that' s no problem. 

The Mayor thanked the Councilmembers and if there are any further questions please email them
and he will get a response as soon as possible.

Representing the city administration will be Pete Buttigieg and James Mueller.

RESOLVE INTO THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE

At 7: 41 p.m. Councilmember Oliver Davis made a motion to resolve into the Committee of the
Whole. Councilmember Karen White seconded the motion which carried by a voice vote of nine
9)  ayes.  Councilmember Gavin Ferlic, Chairperson, presiding. 

Councilmember Gavin Ferlic explained the procedures to be followed for tonight' s meeting in
accordance with Article 1,  Section 2 -11 of the South Bend Municipal Code.

ZONING ORDINANCE FOR PROPERTIES LOCATED

AT 5603 F J NIMTZ PARKWAY, THE SOUTHWEST

CORNER OF F J NIMTZ PARKWAY AND MOREAU

COURT AND PROPERTY NORTH OF AND

ADJACENT TO 3575 MOREAU COURT,  SOUTH

BEND,  IN

Councilmember Karen White made a motion to hear the substitute to Bill 81 - 15.  Councilmember
John Voorde seconded the motion which carried by a voice vote of nine (9)  ayes. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis reported the Zoning and Annexation Committee met and sends this
bill to the full Council with a favorable recommendation. 

Matthew Chappuies, with offices on the 11th Floor of the County City Building, presented the
bill. The land in question is approximately twenty -five (25)  acres rezoning from the Office
District to Light Industrial zoning. Mr. Chappuies provided an aerial view of the location and
other pictures of the property. There are no proposed developments at this time. This comes from
the Area Plan Commission with a favorable recommendation contingent on the written

commitments that restrict uses that are not compatible with the adjacent airport. 

Mike Danch,  1643 Commerce Dr. South Bend, served as the petitioner. The City has found over
the last several years this particular part of South Bend and the city as a whole is becoming more
appealing as a distribution area. This rezoning would allow this property to be used for that
purpose and is an ideal location due to its location near the Bypass and the Toll Road. There are
written commitments that will go with this land that the Airport requested and we have agreed to. 
If anyone requests a change to those commitments the Airport would be notified of those

changes as well. 

There was no one from the public wishing to speak in favor of the bill. 

S.  J.  Szabo,  offices on Mishawaka Ave, spoke in opposition to the bill. He was concerned about
the effect this development would have on the Blackthorn Golf Course. To turn those woods into
an industrial area would be hard on the ambiance of the. course. He proposed the wooded section
be prohibited from any development. 

Mr. Danch responded this is a part of Blackthorn Office Park and there is an overlay district that
defines the architecture and landscaping possibilities which requires them to be very sensitive to
the golf course. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis asked if anyone from the Blackthorn Group submitted questions or
negative comments. 

Mr. Danch responded no. At the meeting where this was discussed with the Blackthorn Owners
there were no concerns and they are fully aware of what' s going on. 

Councilmember Tim Scott voiced his support for this bill. The City has annexed this
development with the support of everyone out there and what we are not doing is maximizing the
potential of land within our city limits that has not been developed.

A PETITION OF THE AREA BOARD OF ZONING

APPEALS FOR THE PROPERTY LOCATED AT 2906

PRAIRIE AVENUE, SOUTH BEND, INDIANA

Councilmember Oliver Davis reported Zoning and Annexation Committee met and sends this
resolution the full Council with a favorable recommendation. 

Ayoka Paek, Building Department 125 S.  Lafayette St.  Suite 100,  served as the presenter. The
Area Board of Zoning Appeals sends this favorably. One adjacent land owner did have questions
and the petitioner agreed to work with them going forward and everything is good between the
two parties. 

David Sewell, Tribal Planner for the Pokagon Band with offices at 58620 Sink Rd. Dowagiac
Michigan, was the petitioner for this bill. This is for a police substation on the site. They intend
to take down the house currently on the site and construct a 46,000 square foot police substation
on the site. This is an office building that would house the tribal police as well as the local
jurisdiction police. There is a possibility of having an interrogation room and the public could
come there seeking safety. There will be no detaining at the site. They will install lighting that
only shines down to alleviate the concerns of the adjacent property owner and in compliance
with site plan approval. 

There was no one from the public wishing to speak in favor of the bill. 

S.  J.  Szabo,  offices on Mishawaka Ave., spoke in opposition to the bill. He asked if the tribal
police are answerable to the same rules of transparency as the South Bend Police are. 

Council President Tim Scott stated that they can only answer or ask questions regarding the
specific petition regarding zoning appeals. 

Councilmember John Voorde made a motion to adopt 16 -03.  Councilmember Karen White
seconded the motion which carried. The resolution was adopted by a roll call vote of nine (9) 
ayes.

an application for auto sales at an old restaurant. Area Zoning appeals sent this with a favorable
recommendation and all opposition has been cleared up. 

Bernard Feeny, 715 S.  Michigan St.,  served as the petitioner. This resolution is for the former
Honkers restaurant on South Michigan St. R &  B Car Company wants to use the former
restaurant to sell cars.  They will occupy the existing parking spaces with the autos for sale, and
there are no changes anticipated for the building at this time.

REGULAR MEETING

February 8th,  2016

16 -08

A RESOLUTION OF THE COMMON COUNCIL OF
THE CITY OF SOUTH BEND,  INDIANA, 
ESTABLISHING A 5- MEMBER ADVISORY SPECIAL
COMMITTEE TO STUDY AND RECOMMEND ALL
REASONABLE AND VIABLE OPTIONS FOR THE
PROPERTY KNOWN AS ELBEL GOLF COURSE AS A
SHORT AND LONG TERM ASSET OF THE CITY OF
SOUTH BEND,  INDIANA

Councilmembers Karen White, At -large Councilmember with offices on the 0 Floor of the
County City Building, and Regina Williams- Preston,  Second District Councilmember with
offices on the 4th Floor of the County City Building, served as the presenters for this resolution. 

Councilmember Karen White thanked Councilmember Jo M. Broden for the work she has done
to bring this resolution before the Council. When there are discussions about a sale or lease of
any park resources,  the City must have full disclosure and transparency. Citizens expect the City
to be good stewards of their tax dollars.  The proposed committee would enhance
communication, transparency, and gather and dissimilating information. All concerned parties
can present their concerns, ask questions, and provide their recommendations for the future of
the golf course. In the interest of the residents and business owners this committee should be
established to review all viable options going forward for Elbel Park. 

Councilmember Regina Williams- Preston read the full resolution. 

Council Attorney Kathleen Cekanski - Farrand explained what a non - binding resolution is. The
committee can advise and make recommendations to the full Council. These are non - binding
recommendations and not final. 

Councilmember Jo M. Broden expressed her belief this resolution is a great compromise for the
city to come together and decide what to do with this great asset. She pointed out a link that is on
the Common Council' s website that has a large amount of relevant financial data as well as
PARC Committee minutes and Park Board minutes as well over the past three years. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis stated there is no question. on the public trust portion of the
committees'  resolution. There has been a public trust issue regarding the Elbel sale and we are
bound as a Council to listen to their concerns.  He hopes this committee will be a spring board to
more permanent discussions and that the community continues to work with the Council going
forward. 

There were no questions from the Council. 

Those wishing to speak in favor of the resolution: 

S.  J.  Szabo,  offices on Mishawaka Ave., thanked the Council for taking the initiative on this
important issue that is surely needed. He supports the intent and respect for the public that is
embodied in this resolution but takes issues with three aspects.  There is no reason to restrict the
committee for forty -five (45)  days.  The committee should not be made up of five (5)  bureaucrats
and should include from the outset members of the public, resources of ecological expertise,  and
members from the local colleges.  Last, he is discouraged of the non - binding nature of this
resolution and the Council should assert itself and make this committee' s recommendations
binding. 

Jason Banicki Critchlow, 3822 W Fourth St.,  thanked the Council for making the public process
more transparent. As the City continues to expand westward, this part may be in the city limits in
the next fifty (50)  to one - hundred ( 100)  years so let' s not rush to a decision. Perhaps there are
other areas where we may need to trim the fat of the Park budget. Let' s make sure if we go
forward with this, the City thinks about what we are doing and not just guess and gamble. 

Pam Clays,  1106 Bell View Ave, applauded the sponsors of this Bill. It was a travesty there was
not more transparency in this process starting out and she agreed there is no reason to limit this

REGULAR MEETING

February 8t",  2016

Committee to forty -five (45)  days.  There is no rush on this, take your time and make a proper
judgment. 

Sharon Banicki, 3822 Ford St, thanked the Council for putting the brakes on the sale.  More
public input should be sought not just the five (5)  hand chosen ones.  Elbel is too valuable of an
asset to let it go to solve a short term money problem. 

Paul Blaschko,  322 E.  Colfax Ave Apt. 209, asked everyone who was with Elbel for Everyone to
stand up.  The group is grateful for their chance to address the PARC Committee earlier today. 
Elbel for Everyone, or at least a large majority of their members,  are in favor of this resolution. It
is a good first step in this process in making sure a wise outcome comes out of all of this. The
residents of South Bend are ready and willing to cooperate with the proposed committee. 

Jen Betz,  511 S.  St. Joseph St,  expressed her appreciation for thexesolution. She asked how the
public participate in robust ways if all the members are government officials. Forty -five (45) 
days is too short to have a ecological assessment, which takes a year to do,  and we really need
that assessment to evaluate what to do with this property. The non - binding portion of the
committee is also troubling as the Park Board are not elected officials and do not have the same
public pressure as public officials. 

Chris Cobb, 215 E Pokagon St 46617, thanked the Council for developing this resolution. When
the decision about the sale of Elbel came up the full Council was going to take that sale until
their was public outcry. This committee' s non - binding resolution, with two non - elected
members, needs to be taken seriously and not simply pushed aside afterwards. More time is
needed than forty -five (45)  days. 

Margaret Pfeil, 511 S.  St. Joseph St.,  added her thanks for the proposal of this resolution. She
also expressed the opinion more time is needed and a yearlong commission should be established
as well. She has great respect for the process and understand why this is a non - binding resolution
but suggest everyone is also bound by higher law and that our consciences are at stake here. 

Benito Salazar, 23818 Grant Rd, totally agrees with the resolution. This is going to be a fantastic
first step. He stressed that we should not forget about the other parks that desperately need
funding. LaSalle Park needs funding, there are no restrooms and no water there. He believes in
what the Council is doing but hopes they do not forget about the other parks. 

Mathew Insley, 511 S.  St. Joseph St., wondered what the official name of the park is.  As far as
he knew the official name is Elbel Park that happens to have a golf course on the property. He
reminded the Council they represent the people and they have been clear a stop button needs to
be pushed for at least a year. Yes the Mayor is popular and the Mayor is certainly a friend to
many of you and many of us and he has done a great job leading this city but he made a mistake
on this one. The Mayor has made this question seem urgent and that they have to make a
decision right now but that' s not true. The City should push stop on this and not just pause. 

Bishop Eddy Miller, 909 N. Bendix Dr., appreciated the efforts of the Council with concern
towards the sale of Elbel Park. He cautioned the Council and reminded them that we do have
about seventy (70)  other Parks that are in desperate need for public services and money. A lot of
the basketball and tennis courts need to be refurbished. He did not speak against Elbel but asked
the Council to please be mindful of those other parks as well when deliberating on this issue. 

Aaron Perri,  321 Walter St.  and Director of Parks in South Bend, thanked the Council for their
leadership on this topic. He looked forward to working with this proposed committee and the
public going forward regarding Elbel. He noted that although this is a non- binding resolution, he
intends to act as a department head dutifully on the recommendation of this committee. There
will be a special Parks Board meeting specifically on Elbel on February 11,  2016. 

Kathryn Osborne, 517 River Ave. South Bend, echoed the thanks of the previous speakers.  She
was pleased to see earlier that the City is in great shape financially and that we have good
stewards who are taking care of the City' s finances. This should hearten everyone to see we are
not in a financial emergency and we can take the time to analyze what should happen with Elbel. 
She stated she thinks this committee will find ways to make Elbel more accessible to everyone

N

REGULAR MEETING

February 8t",  2016

and not pit parks against each other. Overall, the City should be able to say stop and find the
money to keep Elbel a city park. 

No one spoke against the resolution. 

Council Attorney Kathleen Cekanski- Farrand noted the proposed resolution refers to the
property as 26595 Auten Road, which covers the entire three - hundred and fourteen (314)  acres
and is the entire park. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis asked if it is possible the proposed committee could ask for more
time and that their committee be expanded. 

Council Attorney Kathleen Cekanski - Farrand responded they could do that and it would take an
action of the Council as an amendment to the resolution. The Council always has the power to
amend the resolution and expand the days or the membership of the committee. 

Councilmember Regina Williams- Preston thanked the public for coming and speaking in favor
of this resolution. She highlighted there is no reason to rush.  In many of the conversations she
had on this issue one comment stuck with her that the woman said " I came to this because of
turtles but I am staying because of transparency."  This is much more about Elbel, it is about
being transparent and responsive to the public' s interest. She hopes this process serves as a
model going forward because we obviously have other issues to address in South Bend.  The City
needs to start listening to all facets of the community and their issues. 

Councilmember Randy Kelly stated the committee is being put together to look all the issues that
have been brought up. This is not to say we are finished with this in forty -five (45)  days but to
have the chance to talk to experts and interested citizens and make a recommendation that maybe
we do need a year -long study. Just because this committee only lasts forty -five (45)  days does
not mean that is when the process will end, the idea is within that time frame that puts our feet to
the fire, and we can make a good decision that leads to maybe more long term recommendations. 

Councilmember Jo Broden stated the practical concern is we have to open the course for golf this
year. That question of how we do that needs to be addressed quickly and that was the reason for
the shorter time frame.  The first question the committee answers is to figure out what to do this
year because we have golf packages to sell and also a commitment that the course is in an
outstanding condition. This was a measure to make sure the public voices were heard but it is not
only reactionary but is also nimble enough where the circumstances can change. 

Councilmember Dr. Varner stated a big issue is how Elbel is addressed.  The other big issue is
what we do in the long term. This problem will not be solved in forty five days but the issue of
the golf course for this playing year can be addressed in that forty -five (45)  days. He agreed that
if we are going to make this course available it should be in the best shape possible. He
expressed support for raising rates if that is needed and making the course pay for itself if it can. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis stated priorities are needed because there are a lot of separate
issues but the issue that comes first is how to run this golf course and park this coming year. 
There is no reason that some of our parks should be in conditions that have been shared by the
public today. The Parks Department came to us,  and the Council funded their budget, and they
said all the parks would be funded. During the last budget season no one came and talk about the
issues mentioned earlier tonight, plus we approved a Park Bond to take care of those needs. 
These discussions need to happen separately, it is not the parks on the East Side versus the parks
on the West Side. Let' s talk about and figure out what to do about Elbel. We should not have to
compare a park and basketball court. The Council was never told that Elbel was being cautiously
spent out, that' s not fair to the Council and not fair to the people who signed up for
memberships. Those people should want their money back. Councilmember Oliver Davis stated
his appreciation of Aaron Perri and what he said earlier about listening and acting on the
committees suggestions because people needed to hear that and that gives you credibility with
the people. This is a critical point in our cities government because if the people can' t trust us on

this they won' t trust on anything. 

Councilmember John Voorde voiced his support for this resolution and everything that has been
said. He was disappointed in the way this seemed like it was going to play out, you cannot talk

about the importance of transparency and then not act in that manner. The City is paying for
years of neglect in the parks system, there hasn' t been a Parks Bond since the early 1980s and
that was restricted to opening up the East Race. Since then Parks have been underfunded and
now a bond was passed that only passed twenty (20)  to twenty -five (25)  percent of what was
needed. The numbers that we have seen do not justify selling off the gem of the parks system. 

Councilmember Gavin Ferlic thanked the sponsors for introducing the bill which is a great first
step in this process. He expressed hope that a shorter term solution regarding the operations of
the golf course is developed and then a longer term plan, whatever that might be,  comes out of
this. He challenged the public to stay involved not just from a meetings perspective but getting
people out to the park, getting the inner city youth out to the park. If the public wants to see more
access to the park, this Elbel for Everyone group can be a huge part in that. 

Councilmember Karen White expressed her support for the resolution. A lot of the questions and
recommendations in terms of the time frame will be a part of the committee' s first set of actions. 
What is important is the Council is listening and it is encouraging to hear the Park Executive
Director to say that he is listening and that the recommendations will be well received. This
Council is committed to enhancing communication and transparency and everyone will have the
opportunity to have their voices heard by this committee. 

Council President Tim Scott stated once we sell this we don' t get it back so we have to make the
right decision. He reported he has worked with Aaron Perri for a long time and he is the best
person to be transparent and listen to ideas and develop out of the box ideas.  Mr. Perri has been
thrown into this at the last minute so everyone should remember that, but he will give everyone a
fair deal. The dynamic of this Council is amazing in the willingness to do research and be willing
to do the homework needed.  This committee is only step one. This Council is willing to not rush
the decision if that is required. There are multiple groups and interests with a stake in what
happens regarding Elbel and they will all be heard from and considered. 

Councilmember Randy Kelly reported this resolution was sent with a favorable recommendation
by the PARC Committee. 

Councilmember Gavin Ferlic made a motion to adopt Bill 16 -08.  Councilmember Oliver Davis
seconded the motion which carried. The resolution was adopted by a roll call vote of nine (9) 
ayes.
