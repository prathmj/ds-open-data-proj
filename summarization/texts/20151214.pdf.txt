A. PATHWAY PROJECT PRESENTATION -  5 MINUTES

Sarah Heintzelman, offices on the 14th Floor of the County City Building, stated the goal of the
Pathway program is to increase employment opportunities for the citizens of South Bend.  She
reported that in the years of 2014 and 2015 approximately $325 million dollars of private
investment has been invested in South Bend. This investment has caused unemployment to drop
to a rate of 4. 9 percent. In an effort to prepare residents for the opportunities currently available
to residents, the goal of this program is to help citizens better capitalize on these job

opportunities. 

Sarah Heintzelman reported that the Pathway program offers five (5)  training tracts where we
know growth will be developing in the next few years. Citizens will be recruited by a
coordinator, candidates will be assessed by the coordinator and their interests and skills will
determine which tract they are entered into. 

After the candidates choose their tract of choice on the job training will begin. This will include
an employee support network after training is completed if more help is required. 

Sarah Heintzelman reported that multiple organizations were found to partner with this program
including nonprofits and church organizations. Program coordinators will work with unions, 
veteran groups,  and various other organizations as well. 

In an effort to increase success, the Pathway program has a goal to deliver various achievements
in the first six (6)  months.  Some of these goals are working with twenty five (25)  different
agencies, recruit thirty -eight (3 8)  candidates,  maintain a virtual database, create marketing
materials,  and provide quarterly reports on their progress. 

REPORTS OF CITY OFFICES

There was no report from the city offices. Representing the City Administration will be James

PUBLIC HEARINGS

BILL NO. 65 -15

PUBLIC HEARING ON A BILL AMENDING THE
ZONING ORDINANCE FOR PROPERTY LOCATED AT 1637
AND 1641 PORTAGE AVENUE, COUNCILMANIC DISTRICT
NO.  1 IN THE CITY OF SOUTH BEND, INDIANA

Councilmember Oliver Davis,  Chairperson, stated the Zoning and Annexation Committee met
and it was a consensus to send this bill to the full Council with a favorable recommendation. 

REGULAR MEETING

DECEMBER 14.  2015

Matthew Chappuies,  Area Plan Commission with offices on the Eleventh ( 11)  floor of the
County -City Building, presented this bill. Mr. Chappuies reported the petition was to rezone
property in the northwest Portage re- district from Single - Family to Office Buffer District. On site
currently is a dental office and a vacant property. This petition would bring the entire area into
the same zoning and allow for the expansion of the dental office. Across the street is a video
store.  To the north and west are single family homes.  To the east are single family and
multifamily homes. 

Mr. Chappuies stated this is a commercial node that tapers into residential.  He presented pictures
of the property and of the site plan showing the existing building and the proposed expansion. 

Mr. Chappuies reported that the petition came in with a favorable recommendation from the
Area Plan Commission. 

There were no questions from councilmembers. 

Leslie Green,  58867 County Road Five ( 5)  Elkhart Indiana, spoke as the petitioner. He stated the
purpose of the petition is to provide more ample parking and get cars off of the street. 

There were no questions for the petitioner from the Council. 

No one from the public was present in favor of the petition. 

Don Bubaker,  1706 Anderson Avenue South Bend,  spoke in opposition to the petition. He stated
the ordinances currently in place were set up for air quality and aesthetic appearances.  He stated
if you put the retaining wall up you will have problems with trees and long term this is not a
good idea. He stated there will be nowhere to put snow in the winter in this proposed lot. Mr. 
Bubaker stated the business across the street from the property follows all the current ordinances
and is aesthetically pleasing. Mr. Bubaker recognized his idea is not the most cost effective and
provides less parking but is best for the neighborhood in the long -term. 

Petitioner Leslie Green spoke to rebut the opposition. He stated in the ordinance you can put a
fence in to satisfy the needs of the ordinances.  He had no current plan of how to remove the
snow in the winter but believed it would need to be removed and not stock piled. He stated
installing an elevator and second floor would triple the cost of the proposed building right now
by perhaps an additional forty -five thousand to one - hundred thousand dollars. He reported he has
been a contractor for twenty -five (25)  years and can give examples of his work if they are
needed. 

Councilmember Dieter made a motion for favorable recommendation to full Council concerning
this bill. Councilmember Dr. David Varner seconded the motion which carried by a voice vote of
nine ( 9)  ayes.

Councilmember Henry Davis Jr. stated the Public Works Committee met and sends the bill to the
Council with a favorable recommendation. 

Gary Mason, 2123 South Arnold Street, spoke as the petitioner and presenter. He stated the alley
has always been green space and never an alley. He stated this would consolidate the properties
and make it so the neighbors can do their own work on the property. 

There were no questions from Council.

REGULAR MEETING

DECEMBER 14,  2015

Tom Nowack, 2212 Webster St, spoke in favor of the petition. He stated if the City put an alley
there it will cost the City of South Bend a lot of money. 

No one from the public spoke in opposition. 

Councilmember Dieter made a motion for favorable recommendation to full Council concerning
this bill. Councilmember Oliver Davis seconded the motion which carried by a voice vote of nine
9)  ayes. 

BILL NO. 73 - 15

PUBLIC HEARING ON A BILL OF THE COMMON COUNCIL
OF THE CITY OF SOUTH BEND, INDIANA, AMENDING
SECTION 13 -96 OF ARTICLE 10,  CHAPTER 13 OFFENSES
AND MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS AND AMENDING
SECTION 2-  213 OF CHAPTER 2 ADDRESSING A
SCHEDULE OF ORDINANCE AND CODE VIOLATIONS OF
THE SOUTH BEND MUNICIPAL CODE

Councilmember Dieter reported the Health and Public Safety Committee met and sends the bill
to the Council with a favorable recommendation. 

Councilmember Scott,  711 Forest Ave., presented this bill. He stated this petition deals with
irresponsible gunfire in the City because as most people know all shots fired up must come
down. Mr. Scott stated the ordinance would tighten up the fine and demonstrate the City takes all
gunfire seriously. Currently the fine is arbitrary and set by the officer writing the violation and
the fine can vary widely. The bill would set the fine at $ 2,500 maximum. 

Councilmember Scott also stated that the petition would change the ordinance that any firearm
fired would be seized and not returned until proof of payment and valid ownership of firearm. He
stated this should be the purview of the police so the proposal strikes out that part of the
ordinance. Councilmember Scott reported that the Chief of Police also favors this petition. 

Scott Ruszkowski, Chief of Police, was available for questions.  He thanked the Council for
helping with this matter. He reported he does not want to do police work based on monetary
advantage but this is a safety issue and a measure which should be passed. 

Councilmember Dieter questioned what leeway does the City have to reduce the payment if the
person cannot pay the fine? Also, he asked does the Police Department have a mechanism to
enforce ShotSpotter which puts the teeth in this proposed ordinance. 

Chief Ruszkowski answered that officers are not told to stay out of harm' s way. He stated the
officers have to use their discretion in each individual case and ShotSpotter can pinpoint these
locations and if further evidence is found it can be put forward. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis asked what are the average fines currently. He asked how many
fines are given yearly on average and how many on New Year' s and other celebration times. 
Councilmember Davis also asked since ShotSpotter is only available on the northwest side how
will this bill be enforced on the whole City and what is the range of fines? 

Chief Ruszkowski responded that he believes the range is around twenty -five (25)  one - hundred
100)  dollars and did not know how many of these fines are currently being issued. 

Councilmember Scott stated during the research of this bill the average fine was around one- 
hundred dollars ($ 100).  He also did not know how many there were in a year. He stated most of
the gunfire happens during Fourth of July and New Year' s but even in the past two (2)  weekends
we have had random shootings. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis asked how this will work since ShotSpotter is not available
throughout the whole City. 

Chief Ruszkowski responded enforcement will come down to the individual officer to find the
person regardless if ShotSpotter is or is not in place. He reported the public can call in or the

4

REGULAR MEETING

DECEMBER 14,  2015

officer can hear the shots and ShotSpotter is only an aid but the ascetics are exactly the same
regardless. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis expressed his concern that officers may not have the manpower to
enforce this because it has not been enforced in the past. 

Chief Ruszkowski responded that manpower isn' t an issue and the issue is the egregious amount
of gunfire in our community. He stated that the first person to receive the $ 2500 fine will send a
strong message to the community that guns arbitrarily fired cannot be accepted and he again
applauded the Council for bringing this forward. 

Councilmember Henry Davis Jr.  stated celebratory gunshots are not the reason for the bill and
asked if they would change the name of the bill since it gives a false impression. 

Councilmember Scott responded ` celebratory'  is not in the title of the bill but only an informal
title he gave it. Councilmember Scott said irresponsible gunfire is a better term than celebratory. 

Councilmember Davis Jr. said they have his support but asked if you think raising fees will stop
criminal behavior.  He also asked if they have any data that raising fees will stop this type of
negative behavior. 

Councilmember Scott responded that research proves fines do work to stop criminal behavior. 
He gave examples in the past where fines did stop criminal activity and people breaking City

ordinances. 

Councilmember Henry Davis Jr. replied that analogy is apples and oranges.  He asked if they
have more examples. 

Councilmember Scott replied no. 

Chief Ruszkowski responded that we have a large amount of gunfire and said the fine for
possession of a gun illegally is $ 250.  He asked what is so egregious about increasing that to
2, 500 if it will save lives. 

Councilmember Davis Jr. stated we keep raising fines and fees over the past four (4)  years and
he doesn' t think this stops crime because crime has gone up.  He wanted to make sure they were
not starting a precedent of raising fees to stop crime because this has not stopped people from
being bad tenets. 

Councilmember Dr. Varner asked if this applies in an act of self - defense. 

Chief Ruszkowski responded no and that this is also not applicable to a starter pistol or a twenty - 
one ( 21)  gun salute. 

Councilmember Dieter asked where the fines go. 

Councilmember Scott responded that they go to the General Fund. 

No one from the public spoke in favor of the bill. 

Nosha Kasey, representing the Freemont Park Association, spoke in opposition to the ordinance. 
She stated she doesn' t understand how this helps the community because this will lead to more
crime to pay these high fines.  She doesn' t understand how these fines help and not hurt since
they are so high. 

Councilmember Scott responded that he agreed with that and violation is at the discretion of the
Police Department because officers have the right not to give this violation and fine. 

Councilmember Dieter spoke that fines have worked for loud noise issues and stated the intent is
not to collect fines but to stop crimes. He said the Council has passed a lot of ordinances and he
hopes this is enforced. Councilmember Dieter reiterated that bullets do come down and people
have been shot because of this. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis stated this is December 14th and New Year' s is a little over two (2) 
weeks away. He stated the public needs serious awareness since this will take place New Year' s
Day and if this is not enforced to the level it should be the seriousness of it gets washed away

very quickly. Councilmember Davis also stated there needs to be a very clear role of what is self - 
defense because if someone shoots a warning signal his understanding is that a warning signal is
still illegal. He stated there are times when he sees the wisdom of a warning shot and would look
at this bill to reform that because this would harm the victim. He stated he hoped those looking at
that would give some understanding to the importance of shots fired in self - defense. 

Councilmember Dr. Ferlic stated he fully endorsed this public measure. 

Councilmember Davis Jr.  stated Indiana does have a stand your ground law but you still have a
state law that covers us and protects people so they won' t be victims of someone trying to hurt
them. 

Councilmember Dieter made a motion for favorable recommendation to full Council concerning
this bill. Councilmember Ferlic seconded the motion which carried by a voice vote of nine ( 9) 

ayes. 

BILL NO. 74 -15

PUBLIC HEARING ON A BILL OF THE COMMON COUNCIL
OF THE CITY OF SOUTH BEND, INDIANA, AMENDING
CHAPTER 2,  ARTICLE 8,  BY THE ADDITION OF NEW
SECTION 2-  125.  2 ENTITLED POST CITY EMPLOYMENT

RESTRICTIONS

Councilmember White reported that the Personnel and Finance Committee met and send this bill
with no recommendation as they did not have adequate time and wished for public input. 

Councilmember Henry Davis Jr., 5117 Idlewood Dr., spoke as the petitioner. He stated the
attached proposal would alleviate transparency and this bill would call for a one ( 1)  year
prohibition of any City employee for leaving for a company that they worked within their role as
City employees. 

Councilmember Davis Jr.  stated in an employee' s tenure they still have three hundred and sixty - 
five (365)  days from the time they put together a deal.  He stated currently under the Mayor' s
executive order on ethics he has given the ability to wave this order but is silent under the
proposed one ( 1)  year employment ban that is set by State code. He stated the State has a similar
ban to the one he is proposing. He reported he attached the State of Indiana, New York, Federal
Government and City of Chicago bans as well to the ordinance. 

Councilmember Scott asked if this included the Council. 

Councilmember Davis Jr stated yes, however the Council has not negotiated a contract. What
this bill is doing is making sure the people who are purchasing, the Board of Public Works, etc. 
who are making a determination of who gets a contract. Councilmember Davis Jr. said this does
not affect whether your vote should be yay or nay but rather for the folks in Public Works or the
Mayor' s Office who do have that authority. 

Councilmember Scott asked how this will be enforced and who would go and verify that the
person left to work for a company that did business with the City and who would investigate? 

Councilmember Davis Jr. responded that these are our laws and it is not the responsibility of the
taxpayers to hold them responsible. He stated if there is a whistle blower who comes in and says
Mr. Doe is working for Company A that will be enough. 

Councilmember Scott asked has this been tested in court between an individual that has left and
whether it has held up. 

Councilmember Davis Jr. said he has no data but if someone enters an agreement they know the
responsibilities and it is up to that individual. He stated that comes with choosing this job. 

Councilmember Ferlic asked if this prosecuted the individual or the company and stated
employees don' t sign contracts. 

Councilmember Davis Jr. responded that you have a hand book that states your responsibilities
which is an agreement.

REGULAR MEETING

DECEMBER 14,  2015

Councilmember Dieter said we have had dozens of things we have never investigated and given
them to other places to investigate.  He gave the examples of the former police chief and former
deputy mayor who went to work with businesses who had done work with the City after they
left. He asked if each would be investigated if this went through. 

Councilmember Davis Jr. responded that this gives the Council the ability to investigate or
develop an ethics commission to ensure transparency giving the Council more teeth within the
given law to do their job better. He also stated the Council has the opportunity to hire counsel
and has a full -time counsel. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis asked when it was stated earlier that this was done in Indianapolis, 
if all state employees are currently under this rule. 

Councilmember Davis Jr. responded yes. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis asked who would serve on the ethics commission. 

Councilmember Davis Jr. stated that you would have the ability to set that commission and the
Council has that authority. He stated this opens the door to have more authority in this certain

situation. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis asked if employees have to follow this even if they don' t have a
formal contract. 

Councilmember Davis Jr. responded you do have a contract verbally and when you cash your

check. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis asked if those other places that have this have not just left it up to
the corporate counsel. 

Councilmember Davis Jr. responded they have moved away from a one ( 1)  person system. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis asked if this would be for new hires. 

Councilmember Davis Jr. responded yes this is for new hires and not existing employees. 

Councilmember Ferlic asked do you see the City initiating a city suit and seeking monetary

reparations. 

Councilmember Davis Jr. responded I' m giving you the authority to do your job better and that
we can come up with more reasonable ideas for how this works. 

Councilmember Dr. Varner questioned the enforcement mechanism and how it exists. He
thought the idea of an ethics idea is an appropriate idea. 

Councilmember Dr. Ferlic stated this bill says effective January 1"  2016 for any person who
works as an appointee,  employee or official upon separation from the City and that these people
have to go before an ethics committee according to the bill. He asked if the wording is correct. 
He stated Chicago and other cities have multiple exceptions but this bill does not have those

exceptions. 

Councilmember Davis Jr. responded that at the end of the day you are not allowed to misuse the
public trust and the public tax dollars. 

Councilmember Valerie Schey stated she appreciated this concern because there was concern
when the former chief left for ShotSpotter and that might be an example of the sort of behavior
you are trying to address.  She asked the City Attorney if the language is as broad as the
councilmembers are reading it. 

Aladean DeRose, City Attorney, responded that depending on who is interpreting this bill it is
capable of a very broad interpretation down to staff level employees and believed this is a
regulation not a statute of the state law. 

Councilmember Schey stated the spirit of this bill is good but the language should be tweaked. 

Councilmember White stated we may not clean up the bill at this time but I would like to give
the public an opportunity to address the bill. 

7

REGULAR MEETING

DECEMBER 14,  2015

Jessie Davis, P. O. Box 10205,  South Bend Indiana, spoke in favor ofthe bill. He stated he is one
of those people who have brought the Council numerous names of people who have left city
employment and left to work with people who did have deals with companies. He stated a lot of
the people who have been brought to your attention have been working with the City. He gave
the examples of Mark Neil who left here, Chief Teachman, and the former street commissioner. 
He stated you have had numerous state and federal investigations and rumors about millions and
millions of dollars. He stated if the Council doesn' t vote unanimously he can guarantee he will
keep at them. He stated the Council should pass it and tweak it like they do every other

ordinance. 

David Frank, 50520 Burton Wood, stated Jessie Davis has done a great job but this keeps getting
glossed over. Mr. Frank stated we need something in this community that has some teeth. He
stated the Council is responsible for three- hundred million dollars but if we have a conflict of
interest it erodes the public confidence. He stated what Henry Davis Jr. is bringing makes a lot of

sense. 

Charles Hayes,  1135 Quidly Blvd, stated he has been working with the Council and other
government agencies for years and years and believes they are pillars of integrity. He stated this
would only be another layer of bureaucracy. He stated maybe there should be a potential
discussion but there has currently been no accusation of any wrong doing regarding the people
earlier mentioned. Mr. Hayes stated the Council should not support this. 

Councilmember Davis Jr. stated he doesn' t want to get into a conversation of who is wrong and
who done it. He stated he is interested in closing loopholes and how these things are getting
applied to taxpayers. Mr. Davis stated he did not give the South Bend Tribune the examples of
Neal and Teachman. He stated we need a more responsible government and to become more
responsible to the City' s tax dollars. 

Councilmember Dr. Ferlic made a motion to send the bill with an unfavorable recommendation
to full Council. Councilmember Scott seconded the motion which carried by a roll call vote of
six (6)  ayes and three ( 3)  nays ( Councilmember Henry Davis Jr., Councilmember Oliver Davis, 
and Councilmember Derek Dieter).

this is not additional money being appropriated, only transfers.

Details of the appropriations were provided for the Council. Mr. Murphy reported these numbers
are only an estimate. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis asked if Mr. Murphy found if the bill sent by the County is
accurate.  He also asked if there is anything we need to question. 

Mr. Murphy responded that they will look at it but if it looks correct we' ll pay for it. 

Councilmember Dieter asked if the estimates given to the Council accompany that with receipts. 

Mr. Murphy responded that they will ask for receipts. 

Councilmember Dieter asked if they asked for receipts in the past. 

Mr. Murphy responded that they haven' t in the past. 

Councilmember Dieter advised that they should ask for receipts. He stated in the past it has
sometimes only been things hand written on paper and there is a lot of discrepancy that he has
seen during his time on the Council that no one has questioned.

DECEMBER 14,  2015

John Murphy, City Controller, made the presentation for this bill. He stated this bill is for the
enterprise funds, which were talked about in Committee.  These include the Morris which is first
for audio upgrades.  He stated some of the other details are housekeeping measures, transferring
funds with interests from one account to another. Mr. Murphy stated that Councilmember Dr. 
Varner mentioned the large one is part of a larger project which they are doing as a " pay as you
go"  instead of a larger bond. 

There were no questions by the Council. There was also no one from the public to speak in
support or opposition to the bill. 

Councilmember Dieter made a motion for favorable recommendation to full Council concerning
this bill. Councilmember Ferlic second which carried by a voice vote of nine ( 9)  ayes. 

Before Councilmember White, Chairperson, dissolved the Committee of the Whole she
announced Councilmember Oliver Davis had a procedural question for the City Attorney. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis asked the Council Attorney regarding the ethics bill they had just
talked about, if it is voted down in the next part, how this proceeds since Councilmember Davis
Jr. will no longer be on the Council. 

City Attorney Aladean DeRose responded that the bill would need a new sponsor. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis asked if it could be reintroduced next month. 

City Attorney responded that she believed so. 

Councilmember White asked for an example if I would like to, or any other member would like
to, sponsor this bill after working out the questions we have we could carry forward in January. 

City Attorney responded yes. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis asked if this process would have to start all over again. 

It was the opinion of the Council Attorney that since that would be the beginning of a new term
the process would have to start all over again. She reported this is different from a bill being
tabled. 

Councilmember Henry Davis Jr. asked the members who are coming back in January if they are
simply interested in supporting this bill as long as my name is not on the bill. 

Councilmember White responded no. 

Councilmember Henry Davis Jr. asked the Council if they are more interested in changing this
after he leaves. He stated the questions they have on the wording could have been made weeks
ago when this was filed. He stated that this is insulting and this bill was filed four (4)  weeks ago. 

Councilmember White responded no this is not the issue and not the intent.

RESOLUTION 15 -103

A RESOLUTION OF THE COMMON COUNCIL OF THE CITY
OF SOUTH BEND INDIANA, ENCOURAGING THE CITY TO
STUDY THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING A LOCAL
PUBLIC POLLING SYSTEM

Councilmember Ferlic reported the IT Committee met and sends this resolution to the Council

with an unfavorable recommendation. 

Councilmember Henry Davis Jr., 5117 Idlewood Dr., made the presentation for this resolution. 
He stated two (2)  weeks ago there was an idea brought before the Council to issue funds to
support a public polling system. He stated this system would try to do all we can to expand
democracy, constructive conversation, and extend the Council' s reach into the public. He stated
what they are proposing is a system that would allow the community to have the ability to
participate in our discussion. He stated this system is solely about expanding democracy in South
Bend. He stated he is going to leave it up to the person he has been working with to further
explain this proposal. 

David Frank,  50520 Burton Wood, spoke in favor of the resolution. He reported he is a lifelong
resident and has been pushing this plan for a long time. He stated it is time to use the 21St
century
technology to allow our residents input in how their tax money is spent. He stated taxpayers pay
every dime that goes in this community, but they have no input. He stated the reason the
Councilmembers are called representatives is because they are supposed to represent someone
other than themselves. He stated we now have a system that is corrupted by lobbies and special
interests and the people' s voices aren' t heard. Mr. Frank stated five percent ( 5 %)  of the
population now owns eighty -five percent ( 85 %)  of the wealth. We can change this right now in
our community. He stated this proposal will allow the Councilmembers to understand what their
constituents think. Mr. Frank stated that he doesn' t know how they are doing it now. We have a

14

REGULAR MEETING

DECEMBER 14,  2015

plan that will use television to allow the people to start coming up with ideas to make the
community better.  He stated the people in our community need to be more than taxpayers.  We
currently vote on American Idol, CNN, and other things but not what is important. He stated we
vote every two (2)  years for people who talk about transparency but then don' t hear from them. 
Mr. Frank said this is a tool to use the television and the internet to bring issues to the
community and they can be debated on. Right now Comcast uses $ 900,000.00 a year and they
want to take $600,000. 00 of that to implement this program. Mr. Frank said they are working
with WNIT and that this can go to every other public broadcasting across the county. He stated
issues will be addressed in this community either through violence or communication. He stated
we have an excellent communication plan and they have a plan that outlines how this would
work. Mr. Frank stated they are asking for the money initially appropriated by Comcast to be
used for what it is supposed to be used for and that we can set a precedent for other communities
across this country. 

Councilmember Schey stated there is an app that we can do this with that only costs $ 1, 000. 00. 
She stated she loves the idea but wants to do it for less. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis asked if they are aware we have been having problems with
WNIT. He was informed tonight this meeting is not being broadcasted correctly tonight and have
had problems throughout the year. He asked if they are aware of these problems. 

Dave Frank responded I guess not. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis asked have you worked with state representatives who represent
our citizens. 

Councilmember Henry Davis Jr. responded no this proposal has not been presented to any state
representative of this area. He stated this is the local governing body representing local issues. 
Davis Jr. stated this is not a step to create a new republic but enhance the ability to know what
the public thinks about particular issues. He said he understands elected officials have thought
this is to replace them or overthrow the government which is not the case.  He said the app itself
wouldn' t support somebody who does not have a cell phone or know how to work a cell phone. 
He stated that would not include our seniors who do not know how to use those technologies. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis asked has there been a discussion with St. Joe County officials or
Mishawaka Council or the South Bend School Board. 

Councilmember Henry Davis Jr. responded no that has not been started. He stated there is a very
good opportunity to table this in efforts to expand the idea to include those other governing
bodies in the face of this idea. He said he thinks it would be appropriate to do that. 
Councilmember Davis Jr.  stated he thinks Mr. Frank has been very patient over the past eight (8) 
years waiting to get this in front of the Council. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis said what he has heard tonight has been different from what he has
heard from Mr. Frank over the years. He asked if they are on the same page that this is different
from what Mr. Frank has brought before that the votes of this system would replace the
Council' s votes. 

Councilmember Henry Davis Jr. responded yes this is different. He stated regardless there is no
way possible anyone on this Council can overthrow the government through their actions.  He
said he would like to have a responsible conversation. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis said a whole group of other entities should be on this proposal not
just the Council. He stated the proposal should have the School Board and Public Works and
other entities. This is a different discussion than I understood when I first heard about the

800, 000. 00. 

Councilmember Henry Davis Jr. asked if there was any way Oliver Davis as a returning
Councilmember for 2016 would be willing to facilitate those conversations. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis stated he could live with the old idea that was presented. 

Councilmember Dieter asked if they would clarify the purpose of this proposal. He asked if this
is for the City to study this issue or allocating the $600,000.00. 

15

REGULAR MEETING

DECEMBER 14,  2015

Councilmember Henry Davis Jr. responded that this is not legally binding. 

Councilmember Dieter disagreed with him. 

Councilmember Davis Jr. said the money is there for down the line. 

Councilmember Dieter asked if there is going to be a relationship with WNIT for this. 

Councilmember Henry Davis Jr. stated a relationship has started with WNIT over this. 

Councilmember White asked if they would be willing to expand this to more members than the
Council to increase transparency. 

Councilmember Henry Davis Jr. responded yes. 

Those from the public wishing to speak in favor: 

Jessie Davis, P. O. Box 10205,  South Bend Indiana, spoke in favor of this resolution. He stated he
has spoken in favor of this a few times. He stated he thinks this is a great tool to give the
Councilmembers a better tool of knowing what the opinion of their constituency is. He said this
is an opinion poll not necessarily a vote by the public. He stated whether it goes forward tonight
or in a future Council he doesn' t care what they say, there is no way councilmembers talk to the
majority of their constituents. He said this is not something that is going to go away. He said this
gives us a tool to hold you accountable because we are not seeing that transparency currently. 

James Pepple, 52205 Portage Rd., spoke in favor of the resolution. He stated he is a veteran and
recipient of the Indiana Accommodation Medal. He stated that without communication you will
not have success and we have the opportunity to increase communication in this community. He
stated everything in the world has communication and if you do not have it you are going to have
failure. He asked if there was communication with the people when they changed the roads to
two (2)  ways.  He said if we do not have communication we are going to fail. 

Reverend Sylvester Williams, 702 Lincolnway West, spoke in favor of the resolution. He said
four (4)  years ago he talked to the Council about public access.  He said you are right Councilman
Davis WNIT is down. He said that is hindsight though and this is future sight. He said radio is
here and is going to be here and the only reason we are partnering with David Frank is because
we are getting people involved with getting decisions forward. He said don' t drop the ball on this
like you did four (4)  years ago with public access.  He said people who don' t have TV can use
radio as well. Reverend Williams said this is about getting citizens involved and hopefully the
next Council will be interested in this. 

No one from the public spoke in opposition to the resolution. 

Councilmember White stated she believes going forward this has to include the other local

government entities. 

Councilmember Ferlic stated he has seen presentations on technology that could be used for
100 or $300 a month for a City to collect feedback which would be very valuable. He said he
understands this resolution is simply looking into the idea but that can be misinterpreted by the
media and I don' t support the way it is written right now. 

Councilmember Henry Davis Jr. stated he wouldn' t expect Councilmember Ferlic to support this. 

Councilmember Dieter stated he encourages the next Council to look into this. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis stated there has been misunderstanding on this resolution. He
stated he likes where this is going but wants to include the other entities. He said he appreciates
that we are looking at this again and stated that other cities have other entities that are
broadcasted as well and it should not just be the Council. He said he likes the concept but it
needs to be expanded. 

Councilmember Dr. Varner stated this is going to be the same discussion as the adoption of the
IT is far
Public Access Channel which had been done away with. He stated the reach of "
beyond the City of South Bend and those other entities such as Elkhart need to pay a price in

16

REGULAR MEETING

DECEMBER 14,  2015

whatever this is. He stated if South Bend has to go it alone with this it' s not feasible under those
circumstances, it has to be other entities buying into this. 

Councilmember Dr. Ferlic stated he attended a meeting at Notre Dame which David Frank may
be interested in which is an App and web application which can be used for less than $200 for
the City. He stated the whole app is trying to get all citizens using this. He stated this is a way to
reach all the citizens and hopes David Frank reaches out to them. He thinks the ideas are great
but it' s obviously the $600, 000.00 price tag that I disagree with. 

Councilmember Henry Davis Jr. spoke in rebuttal to the statements of the other councilmembers. 
He stated that radio and TV are encompassing to all citizens while an app would not reach all
residents. He stated he is not against the app idea but wants to reach all people. In regards to
Councilmember Dr. Varner' s comments about including Elkhart, Councilmember Davis said he
wanted to keep this program just to St. Joseph County and South Bend. He stated Elkhart, 
LaPorte, Niles and other entities is too far reaching at this time. 

Aladean DeRose,  City Attorney, stated that she was concerned about the language of the
resolution if it went through because it refers to a specific plan and the next Council would be
required to only look into this proposal.  She suggested amending the resolution to also say
including but not limited to ". 

Councilmember Henry Davis Jr. stated that the proposed additional language would include the
proposal of looking into an app and they were not interested in that and they were only interested
in their proposed system. He stated this resolution was intended for this specific proposal. 

Councilmember Dieter made a motion to amend the resolution to include the language proposed
by the City Attorney. Councilmember Oliver Davis seconded the motion which carried by a
voice vote of eight (8)  ayes and one ( 1)  nay ( Councilmember Henry Davis Jr.). 

Councilmember Dieter made a motion to adopt Bill 15 -103 as amended. Councilmember Schey
seconded the motion which carried by a roll call vote of nine ( 9)  ayes.
