America a full two (2)  years for construction during the tax abatement which is standard. The
construction is going well with a projected completion date in September 2016.

the petitioner for this bill. Mr. Ryan explained how Real America came into this project and tax
abatement after it had been granted to another company. Real America is moving forward as
quickly as possible on this project. The building will hold sixty -seven ( 67)  market rate
apartments and commercial space as well. The projected grand opening is September of 2016. 

There were no questions from the Council. 

No one from the public wished to speak in favor or in opposition of the bill.

PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR

Samuel Brown, 222 E Navarre St.  South Bend, informed the Council that the Committee on
Martin Luther King Blvd is making progress and they have more public meetings to be held. He

10

REGULAR MEETING

March 14,  2016

also brought to the Council his concern for the property of 1408 Elwood Ave. The property
owner is not living up to his expectations of making that property safe for the nearby residents. 
Mr. Brown asked the Council to ask Code Enforcement to look into that property so it is safe for
the citizens of South Bend. 

Sharon Banicki, 3822 Ford St., brought forth a concern she has regarding a police chase that
damaged her property. As a result of the police chase her fence was damaged and Code
Enforcement sent her a letter stating she has thirty (30)  days to fix the fence. It will take longer
than thirty (30)  days for the lawsuit to go through and fix the fence. 
Council President Tim Scott and Councilmember Oliver Davis asked her to send the information
to them. 

Jason Banicki Critchlow, 3822 Ford St., stated his appreciation that Elbel is open and will be run
by the city this year. He expressed concern about the talk about raising rates and thinks it is a bad
strategy to make the course more competitive. Mr. Banicki Critchlow also expressed his concern
about the potential of the County and the City to raise the wheel tax from $25 to $75.  The
residents of South Bend cannot afford those increases and he cautioned the Council against
taking that option. 
Gary King, 730 N Hill St. South Bend, wished to talk about the new flag design but because he
can' t he will send the Councilmembers emails. 

Keith D., 750 Idlewood Ln Mishawaka, asked for respect and recognition for helping bring in
250,000 to $500,000 from the Woman' s Expo on March 3,  2016. He stated that he sent emails
and called the Council many times and never received any type of response. He asked for the
Council to set a procedure in place to return phone calls and emails because they were clearly
forgotten about. 

ADJOURNMENT

There being no further business to come before the Council, President Tim Scott adjourned the
meeting at 8: 05 p.m.
