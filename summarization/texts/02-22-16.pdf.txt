A RESOLUTION OF COMMON COUNCIL OF THE

CITY OF SOUTH BEND, INDIANA PUBLICLY

THANKING ALL OF THE SOUTH BEND POLICE

DEPARTMENT VIPS VOLUNTEERS FOR THEIR

SERVICE TO OUR COMMUNITY

Council President Tim Scott asked all the VIPS Volunteers to come forward. He read the
resolution in full and Alkeyna Aldridge handed each VIPS a copy of the resolution. 

Council President Tim Scott expressed his gratitude towards the VIPS Volunteers and all the
hard work they do for the City of South Bend. They give up their time so that the police can be
ready at any time for an emergency and that is a vitally important role. 

Mayor Buttigieg thanked the Council for recognizing these wonderful individuals. If these
volunteers did not give their time freely the Police force simply would not be able to afford those
services and the City as a whole would suffer. This group of volunteers is one of the most
interesting and fun groups in the City as well. 

Police Chief Ruskzowski stated that this group saved over $130, 000.00 for the Police
Department last year. The hours served that were mentioned in the resolution are only the
documented hours and they dedicate even more hours that are not always documented. These
volunteers do things cops don' t want to do regardless of weather conditions and it is such a huge
savings financially and mentally for our police. 

No one from the public spoke in favor or in opposition of the bill. 

Every Councilmember voiced their support for the VIPS Volunteers and were appreciative of the
tremendous amount of time and effort they dedicate to South Bend.

LOCATED AT 3620 DEAHL COURT, 
COUNCILMANIC DISTRICT NO.  1 IN THE CITY OF
SOUTH BEND,  INDIANA

Councilmember John Voorde, Vice - Chairperson of the Area and Zoning Committee, reported
they met and sent this bill to the full Council with a favorable recommendation. 

Angela Smith, Area Plan Commission with offices on the 11th Floor of the County -City
Building, served as the presenter for this bill. The petitioner is seeking to rezone from the Light
Industrial District to Mixed Use District to allow for an adult daycare center and associated uses. 
The property is just north of Cleveland Rd. and is fairly secluded from the road and behind much
of the vegetation on the property. They do not intend to change much of the site plan as most of
the surrounding areas are wetlands which would need special approval to change. The Area Plan
Commission gave this bill a favorable recommendation. 

Greg Kiel, 1126 Lincolnway East South Bend, served as the petitioner for this bill. This would
provide Corvilla more space for their offices but as well as the opportunity of opening an adult
daycare center described earlier. This is a good fit as it is very accessible for the clients since
many have mobility issues. The adults would come in for day activities including exercise, 
crafts,  and other educational activities.  Some of the proposed improvements would include

revamping the restrooms. 

There were no questions from Councilmembers. 

No one from the public spoke in favor or in opposition to the bill. 

Councilmember Karen White made a motion to send this bill to the full Council with a favorable
recommendation. Councilmember Dr. David Varner seconded the motion which carried by a

Councilmember John Voorde, Vice - Chairperson of the Area and Zoning Committee, reported
they met and sent this bill to the full Council with a favorable recommendation. 

Angela Smith, Area Plan Commission with offices on the 11th Floor of the County -City
Building, served as the presenter for this bill. The petitioner is seeking to rezone from
Community Business to General Industrial. This is an extension of the Kuert Concrete Business
that operates to the north of the site and are already zoned as General Industrial. At one point a
retail building operated there but since then the space has been used for outdoor storage of
materials and for display of the merchandise. Angela Smith provided images of the site to the
Council and public. The storage will be screened with a six (6)  foot fence around the facility. 
The petitioner will also install perimeter landscaping and a proposed new sign on the property. 
The Area Plan Commission sends this with a favorable recommendation. 

Brad Webb,  General Manager with Kuert Concrete 3402 Lincolnway West South Bend, served
as the petitioner for this bill. The main intent is to store merchandise in the corner of this lot
which the original zoning would not have allowed for. Mr. Webb provided a few images of the
proposed site after the fence and landscaping were built.

FOR CERTAIN DEPARTMENTAL AND CITY

SERVICES OPERATIONS IN 2016 OF $68, 000 FROM

PARK NON - REVERTING CAPITAL FUND ( #405) 

Councilmember Randy Kelly, Chairperson of the PARC Committee, reported this Committee
sends the bill to the full Council with a favorable recommendation. 

Aaron Perri, Executive Director of South Bend Parks with offices at 321 Walter St., served as the
presenter for this bill. This takes $ 68,000. 00 from a Golf Non - Reverting Fund that is made up of
revenues from Golf activities over the past several years.  This is money that has been budgeted
to be spent but was not for various reasons.  There has been limited capital investments at Elbel
the past few years and this bill makes it right and fixes problems with the course including
repairs to greens and tee - boxes.  It is the intention to have golf at Elbel this year. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis stated the key is that we will have golf at Elbel this year. He asked
what will be done differently going forward so that items that were budgeted are actually spent. 

Mr. Perri reported he looks forward with more communication with the Council regarding any
changes in how budgeted money is spent and market plans. Also, the Parks Department has set

up a page on its website where all major park investments and projects can be tracked in real
time. 

Those from the public who spoke in favor of the bill: 

Jesse Davis, P. O Box 10205,  supported getting funds out to Elbel and going forward in the future
the space is still used for golf. 

Mark McDonald,  17180 Wheatridge Ct. Granger, voiced his support for the bill. Over the past
twenty (20)  years he has played golf at Elbel with a number of groups and societies. He wishes
to see that this money is spent on the tee -boxes and greens which is a consistent complaint of
golfers. Elbel is a beautiful golf course and should remain a golf course. The rounds have gone
down in recent years because of the current state of the course and if the city charges what they
need to charge to break even so be it. 

No one from the public spoke in opposition of the bill.

Aaron Cobb, Community Investment with offices on the 14th Floor of the County -City Building,

16 -10

A RESOLUTION OF THE COMMON COUNCIL OF THE CITY
OF SOUTH BEND, INDIANA, SUPPORTING ADDITIONAL
RESEARCH INTO A POTENTIAL FOOD AND BEVERAGE
TAX IN ST. JOSEPH COUNTY, INDIANA

Councilmember Randy Kelly, Chair of the PARC Committee, reported they met and send this
bill with no recommendation to the full Council. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis made a motion to accept the substitute bill on file with the City
Clerk. Councilmember Karen White seconded the motion which carried by a voice vote of nine
9)  ayes. 

Councilmember Randy Kelly, 1325 E. Wayne St South Bend, served as the presenter for this
bill. This bill is to research a potential food and beverage tax as a development tool and if it is a
viable option for our area. This research would include looking at other alternatives as well to the
tax. This resolution states the Council is interested in looking at this more closely and doing real
research on the potential of the tax. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis asked what is the biggest rational towards having a resolution
rather than just going ahead and doing this research without having a resolution. 

Councilmember Randy Kelly responded since this would initially have to come from the State
Legislature, the purpose of the resolution is to show them the Council is interested in researching
this topic and has a desire to explore options regarding the food and beverage tax. For the tax to
pass it would need to pass by at least two of the three local legislative bodies and this would
show at least one of them is interested in starting the conversation. 

Councilmember Randy Kelly stated there is the possibility to hold joint committees with all three
of the local legislative bodies together to hear public input. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis asked how has that worked in the past. 

REGULAR MEETING

February 22,  2015

Council Attorney Kathleen Cekanski - Farrand stated there is no problem legally with doing so
but it has not been done in the past. In the interest of transparency and dialogue it would be a
good idea. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis asked if there has been any contact on the County Council to
consider that option. 

Councilmember Randy Kelly responded not yet but he would be more than happy to start
making calls. 

Those from the public wishing to speak in favor of the bill: 

George Horn,  100 N. Michigan St.  South Bend, spoke in favor of the resolution. He is the
president of the Potawatomi Zoological Society. The Zoo opened in 1902 and is the oldest zoo in
the State of Indiana. It now houses over four - hundred (400)  animals as part of its zoo family that
have provided joy, educational programs, and conservation activities to our community. These
animals depend on us for their health and wellbeing which is why the Zoological Society has
been a driving force behind the request for this resolution and the potential tax of a fund to help
infrastructure improvements. The part of the tax the Zoo is requesting is one quarter of one
percent (. 25 %) realizing the resolution proposes capping that tax at one percent ( 1 %).  This would
raise approximately over $22 million dollars over twenty (20)  years, to help fund the
infrastructure improvements needed at the zoo. Nationally recognized experts have been brought
to build a master plan going forward in the future. The plan was approved by the Park Board and
calls for $37 million dollars in infrastructure improvements. The Zoo hopes that this tax along
with $15 million from private investment should pay for the improvements that are needed. The
request does not seek funds for operational funds but only capital improvements. The Zoo has
the rarest big cat in the world, the Amur Leopard, in 2015 the zoo had three cubs born and they
live in a building constructed in 1936.  These are the type of improvements we want to make. Mr. 
Horn asked the people in the audience to stand who were supporting this resolution. 

Mindy Aben, 4215 Edison Lakes Pkway Mishawaka, supported the food and beverage tax. She
is a corporate sponsor of the Zoo through Northwestern Mutual. She has been a corporate
sponsor of the Zoo for the past three (3)  years.  The Zoo brings approximately $3 million dollars
a year into our community. By moving forward with the tax and the master plan that revenue
number will go up even more. From a financial and from a family perspective, the zoo is a great
asset to this community and this tax will allow the zoo to only becoming a better service for the
community. 

Michael Hasick,  138 S.  Hawthorn, thanked the Council for allowing this issue to come forward
for public debate and comments.  In 1995,  he and his wife relocated from Florida to South Bend
which was her hometown, six children later he can attest that this is a great place to raise a
family. South Bend is truly blessed to have fantastic assets and the zoo is one of them and a
fixture in the South Bend community. Many of the zoo exhibits and facilities were built during
the depression or the 1950s and 1960s. The zoo has many needs including water drainage
problems, storm water issues,  and how the public, especially the disabled,  enter and exit the zoo. 
The master plan goes far beyond sustaining the zoo but takes a long term look at the site and how
to keep the zoo a valuable asset and fixture within our community. This tax would provide the
means for this plan. 

Marcy Dean, Zoo Director with offices at 500 S.  Greenlawn South Bend, spoke in support of this
resolution. The Zoo has been leading the initiative to enact a food and beverage tax in St. Joseph
County to help fund improvements laid out in the master plan. This .25 % food and beverage tax
is a great fit funding wise for these proposals. As more people are brought into the community
they will spend more money dining out. The zoo is also following a precedent set by many of
their peers who receive zoo only dedicated tax funding. The Akron Zoo is a perfect example of
how funds like this can transform an institution from a local attraction to a regional destination. 
Attendance at the Akron Zoo rose after a county wide tax levy from 100,000 to almost 400, 000
annual visitors which has provided an economic boon for the region. There are only a handful of
accredited zoos that do not receive dedicated tax funding. Based on current membership
demographics 33%  of members reside from outside St. Joseph County spanning over seventeen
different states.  South Bend is still number one in membership and visitation even with this large

REGULAR MEETING

February 22,  2015

regional reach. This plan allows for increased expansion of our reach and bringing more people
into our community. When fully implemented, zoo visitation could exceed 350,000 to 400,000
guests annually. This plan would create not only local construction jobs but also jobs at the zoo. 
Most importantly the plan enhances guest experiences with unique exhibits, provides new
attractions,  animal feeding, and interactive opportunities. The zoo thanks the Council for the
consideration of this resolution. 

Josh Sisk, 500 S.  Greenlawn,  spoke in favor of the resolution. This dedicated tax is not only
important for the zoo but for wildlife conservation at a global scale. The zoo is accredited by the
Association of Zoos and Aquariums and this accreditation partners us with over 230 other zoos
across the country. All these zoos work together to save wildlife through breading programs and
visitor education. Biologists predict over half of common zoo animals will be extinct in the wild. 
This is why zoos are so important. State of the art exhibitory will not only provide our animals
the best level of care but also allow the zoo to participate more in these breeding programs. This
is not just a quality of life issue for the animals at the zoo but for the South Bend community as

well. 

Julian Morris, 2216 Perchman' s Tr. South Bend, came to support this resolution for three
reasons.  First, she is a transplant to this community and has lived in many different places and
the Potawatomi Zoo has so much potential to be one of the best zoos in the country. The ratings
for the zoo over the past five to ten years have started to rise and this plan can only help those
ratings.  Second,  she is a mother and the zoo provides excellent resources in education and
engagement for her children. Third, the master plan helps grow the ability of the zoo to help
protect and grow these endangered species populations. 

Karen Selmer,  1002 S.  Ironwood Dr. Mishawaka, is a volunteer for the zoo.  She expressed her
support for this resolution. During her time as a volunteer she has seen firsthand the personal
impact of showing children and adults the beauty and wonder of seeing these animals up close. 
There is only one place in South Bend where you can get that experience. People from all over
the area and the country come to see our zoo and that can only increase with this dedicated tax. 

Todd Wolfer, 15814 Ashville Ln Granger, spoke in support of the resolution. He moved to the
South Bend area in 1992 as a poor college graduate with no connections to the area. There were
few things that he could do at that time to get involved and feel a part of this community and
going to the zoo was one of them. Now after being married and having kids he has even more
connections with the zoo in his life. He takes both of his children regularly to the zoo and those
experiences are invaluable. One of the incredible things about this is it is not a major undertaking
to pack up the family and go to the zoo. The difference that this zoo makes for the community is
immeasurable. As a conservative he generally does not like the idea of more taxes, but he stands
here pledging his support for this because it is so important and is targeted to a specific need that
benefits the community as a whole. There are a lot of great assets in the community but we only
have one zoo. 

Those from the public wishing to speak in opposition: 

Jesse Davis, P. O.  Box 10205,  spoke in opposition to the bill. There is a lot of concern regarding
all the trash rates,  water rates,  sewer rates and all the various taxes that have been brought to bear
on this community. Is this going to be a tax that is just going to generate money for this master
plan or is it going to be in place forever? It seems every time we have one of these master plans
it is the public who ends up paying millions and millions of dollars. Mr. Davis stated as a father
and grandfather he has bought family memberships at the zoo and he loves the zoo, but there are
a lot of people who cannot even afford to go to the zoo.  There are some better ways that they
might be able to generate revenue themselves. 

Jason Banicki Critchlow,  3822 W Ford St., reiterated Mr. Davis'  concerns.  The City
government should live within their means. The zoo knows it can only get this $37 million
dollars through this tax and it is not fair to ask everyone to fit the bill for that for one entity. If
these species are really going to be extinct in the wild, they are then caged show animals which
is why zoos across this country have decreased in popularity no matter what the efforts. If they
cannot come up with the money through donations then do what everyone else has to do and
make tough decisions.  Mr. Banicki Critchlow claims he runs a multimillion dollar business

REGULAR MEETING

February 22,  2015

through a corporation he works for and he doesn' t get to go back and charge more after the fact. 
There are bigger issues in this city than the zoo. There are children going to be starving in our
community every night. There are people who are still sleeping in our streets every night. So $ 22
million dollars allocated for the zoo is not something the city needs to focus on. The City needs
to stop funding special interests. 

Samuel Brown, 222 S.  Navarre St.,  spoke against the bill. He stated he is for the zoo but is not
for the tax. The Wheel Tax turned him off to taxes in this county. There has to be another way to
fund this zoo because it is an important asset to the community. 

Mark McDonnell, 17180 Wheatrdidge Ct. Granger, he stated he has owned a fine dining
restaurant in South Bend for twenty five (25)  years.  He stated he has no enmity towards the zoo
and was a member of the zoo for a time. Restaurants have seen and fought these taxes across the
nation for various reasons.  There is nothing fair about a single industry tax, an industry where
everyone knows its really hard to stay in business and to make money. To make two percent
2 %) profit before interest is a monumental achievement, every single percentage is important. 
These taxes do not sunset once they are imposed and usually just increase. The zoo is a local
attraction and this tax is not a tourist tax. On average, eighty -seven percent ( 87 %) of these taxes
are paid by local people. Mr. McDonnell asked why not tax all retail instead ofjust one industry
or tax groceries which are not taxed. It is not just or fair to tax one industry. 

Kurt Janowski,  828 E. Jefferson Blvd., 828 E. Jefferson Blvd, echoed what Mr. McDonnell said. 
He voiced his support of the zoo and the wonderful things they do and their master plan but he
does not support industry specific taxes. The only example of an industry specific tax that gets
large portions of support are Hotel /Motel taxes because those are indeed tourist taxes and not
paid by residents by and large of the community. If the Council decides this is such an amenity
that needs public support then it should find its way back into the City' s budget. To levy an
industry specific tax, despite his support for the zoo, does not makes sense to him. This County
already has a higher than average property tax rate, so adding to that already high tax burden is
unnecessary. 

Councilmember Randy Kelly pointed out that this was the spirit of this resolution, to have this
discussion on the pros and cons of a food and beverage tax. The zoo has spearheaded this
discussion and deserves recognition for the good work that they do every day. To be clear, this
resolution does not target the zoo specifically. There was in the County resolution but this one
simply states the City is interested in researching this tax as a potential development tool, what
entities might develop from it, and looking at other viable alternative options for funding. This
resolution is meant to start that conversation. 

Councilmember Regina Williams- Preston stated she is interested in exploring this and learning
more about the options for this tax in addition to the zoo like sidewalks and different things
along those lines. Maybe this tax makes sense,  maybe it doesn' t but it certainly deserves a

conversation. 

Councilmember Randy Kelly wanted it to be known that this is not a new idea or proposal and
over twenty (20)  counties and municipalities have a food and beverage tax. There is precedence
for this kind of tax. 

Councilmember Jo M. Broden added that she has a mixed mind on this given the lack of data or
discussion in terms of the impact that this tax would have on industries that do operate on tight
margins.  She expressed her interest in continued research but is not sure of how much influence
this resolution is going to have down state. 

Councilmember Dr. David Varner stated he does not understand the purpose of the resolution in
general.  If the intent is to take it to the state legislature to learn more that is not something he is
in support of. A tax solution should not be the first option vetted, the resources the City has
already include a number of taxes already in existence which are intended to support these types
of programs.  Some of the capital needs of the zoo could possibly be listed under economic
development which would make them available for TIF money. Perhaps there should be some
type of non - reverting fund set up which may help this situation as well. These options should be

looked at first before anyone considers a tax. If those have been exhausted then lets petition the
legislature. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis stated in 2013 he supported the zoo going independent for a large
reason because it would prevent them from having these types of discussions. If the City is going
to take on these burdens then why did we not keep the zoo under the Parks Department? This
resolution is still unclear about what the official stance of the City is. As this requires two thirds
of the local legislative bodies, this will be very difficult for people to say only the zoo deserves
some of this money. Mr. Davis expressed his support of the options mentioned by Dr. Varner for
possible revenue building for the zoo.  To put this all on the back of one industry is a problem. 
This resolution only allows for one discussion which is a mistake. Given that so many other
taxes and fee increases are coming up, it is not a good time now to be talking about another tax
on the citizens of South Bend. For those individuals who came to speak from Mishawaka and
Granger to please call their County Councilmembers and put the pressure on them for a change
and put the pressure on the City of Mishawaka for a change. If the pressure is always going to
fall on South Bend then let' s have it be the South Bend zoo again. 

Councilmember John Voorde expressed on a personal level he has never been afraid of
additional revenue sources as long as they are fair and even handed. In the 1980s he supported a
food and beverage tax and an entertainment tax to fund Coveleski Stadium which became a drain
on every department in the city. Other special projects, regardless of their value to the city, for
the last thirty (30)  years have taken resources from our Parks Department. Regarding the Zoo
and other parks recreational activities, they are a vital economic development tool and attractions
for our area. If we need to find new revenue sources or look at existing ones they should be part
of the discussion as well. The City has many things that need done and we are being foolish if we
do not consider new revenue sources especially with the tax caps coming up in 2020.  The time to
do this research and have these conversation is now. 

Councilmember Gavin Ferlic thanked everyone who came out to speak and to Randy for
bringing this forward. Nothing in this resolution is zoo specific and it is only looking at a food
and beverage tax and what entities could potentially benefit from such a tax. It is important we
study all viable options which is what this resolution does. He thanked the restaurant business
owners who came out and spoke because their input will be vital as well. There needs to be
research into whether this has been more of a burden on restaurants or has driven growth in those
other communities who have adopted this tax. If through research it is determined that such a tax
would be beneficial then the Council should open up the debate to the broader public for input. 

Councilmember Karen White expressed her support for many of the comments made by her
colleagues.  Since this is simply asking for more research and starting this conversation, it is
vitally needed because research should and can be done on the effects of this tax in other
communities. 

Council President Tim Scott thanked Dr. David Varner and the business owners for their

perspectives on this. If this resolution is not passed the conversation will not start and those other
alternatives will not be developed. Regardless of what happened in the past,  the City and the
County and the City of Mishawka can work together and have intelligent conversations even if
there are disagreements.  He stated his support for this and his task of pulling these various local
Council together because it is important and it should happen. There is no tax going into effect
today and it does not necessarily mean it' s going to happen later on but this is a needed step to
bring the local communities together. 

Councilmember Gavin Ferlic made a motion to adopt the subsititue bill. Councilmember Randy
Kelly seconded the motion which was adopted by a roll call vote of seven ( 7)  ayes and two ( 2) 
nays ( Dr. David Varner and Oliver Davis).

NEW BUSINESS

There was no new business. 

PRIVILEDGE OF THE FLOOR

Jesse Davis, P. O. Box 10205 South Bend, questioned if the Council is still responding to the
questions raised at Privilege of the Floor and that he has not seen a response in months. This has
been a good year so far so keep it up. 

Jason Banicki Critchlow, 3822 W Ford St.,  expressed his dissatisfaction with the Western Ave
project. Anytime between 2: 30 p.m. and 6: 00 p.m. is a nightmare for traffic. Just three (3) 
months ago the Council was discussing a trash rate increase and that was supposed to be it and
now there is discussion of a water rate increase. The 14th Floor comes every few months asking
for more money. It' s time to find alternatives instead of asking the citizens to foot the bill for

12

REGULAR MEETING

every project. Mr. Banicki Critchlow asked the Council to put pressure on the Mayor to finally
figure out how to budget properly until incomes come up. The average household income in his
neighborhood is less _than $ 20, 000. 00.  Those people cannot afford all the new taxes and rate
increases, those people are not getting a raise. 

Samuel Brown, 222 E. Navarre South Bend, the MLK Street Naming Committee will have a
press conference on February 25th at 1: 30 p.m. to talk about the extension of MLK St. that has
come out of the committee. The plan is to extend the current street to the north and the south. 
There will be public meetings held and the street will affect the 1St,  2" d,  and 6th Districts. He is
proud of the Mayor and the Council for taking initiative to get this done. 

Mr.. Scoby responded he has had a street committee with over thirty (30)  people over seven years
ago to look into the MLK Street naming. Mr. Skobie asked how you can organize a seven man
street committee, which has been kept under the cover, over this thirty (30)  pastor committee. 
There has been a lot of stink regarding this committee so lets put it on the ballot and let the city
vote on it. 

ADJOURNMENT

There being no further business to come before the Council, President Tim Scott adjourned the
meeting at 9: 15 p.m.
