A RESOLUTION OF THE COMMON COUNCIL OF

THE CITY OF SOUTH BEND,  INDIANA, PROUDLY & 

PUBLICLY HONORING AND COMMENDING
MAESTRO TSUNG YEH FOR HIS EXEMPLARY AND
EXCEPTIONAL MUSICAL TALENTS AND

LEADERSHIP FOR 28 SEASONS AS MUSIC
DIRECTOR OF THE SOUTH BEND SYMPHONY

Councilmember Dr. David Varner read the resolution in its entirety. 

Tsung Yeh thanked the Council for giving him such a wonderful honor. The last few months
have been wonderful and South Bend has been so gracious in their support of him and his family. 
Mr. Yeh stated he still remembers twenty -eight (28)  years ago when he arrived in South Bend
and it was a bitterly cold winter but the people were very warm. Originally, the plan was not to

REGULAR MEETING

JULY 11,  2016

stay in South Bend for so long but this community became Mr. Yeh' s home. Mr. Yeh stated he
put three ( 3)  children through the South Bend public school system and all three ( 3)  have grown
up wonderfully. The past twenty -eight (28)  years have been absolutely wonderful and it' s a great
accomplishment that now the people in this area do not have to travel to Chicago or New York to
hear a world class orchestra but instead have one right here in South Bend. 

Those from the public wishing to speak in favor of the bill: 

Samuel Brown, 222 East Navarre Street, spoke in favor of the bill. It is very impressive and
moving that Mr. Yeh put three ( 3)  fine children through the public school system who then went
on to great universities. Mr. Brown thanked Mr. Yeh for being a wonderful member of this

community. 

Mayor Pete Buttigieg, offices on the 14th Floor of the County -City Building, spoke in favor of
the bill. South Bend punches above our weight class and one of the great examples of that is our
tremendous symphony. Not many cities of our size boast a symphony orchestra with such
professionalism and talent. That is a credit to Mr. Yeh' s leadership. Mayor Buttigieg stated he
feels qualified to speak about Mr. Yeh on three ( 3)  accounts.  First, as one of the young people
who was bussed in to learn about music at such a young age and experience his youth concerts. 
Second, as Mayor of a City that is made better by his extraordinary talent and contributions. 
Finally, as a musician who has performed a couple of times under his direction. Mr. Yeh has a
remarkable capacity for being engaging and putting a person at ease while simultaneously
inspiring the person to do their very best possible. It will be a hard act to follow but the
Symphony is excited to look for the very best person to continue on such a great legacy. Mayor
Buttigieg thanked Mr. Yeh and his family for everything they have done to make this community
a better place. 

No one from the public spoke in opposition of the bill. 

Councilmember Regina Williams- Preston thanked Mr. Yeh for his service to South Bend. She
thanked him especially for all the work he has done bringing beautiful music to our local

schools. 

Councilmember Jo M. Broden thanked Mr. Yeh for bringing out the very best in this symphony
which is such a gift to South Bend. Also, she expressed gratitude for all the work Mr. Yeh has
done for the youth of South Bend. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis read the poem My Symphony by William Ellery Channing. 
Councilmember Davis stated Mr. Yeh has embodied that poem very well especially living
content with small means.  Mr. Yeh has taken a small city and given us a great symphony. 

Councilmember John Voorde thanked Mr. Yeh for all his service to South Bend and the arts. 

Councilmember Gavin Ferlic thanked Mr. Yeh for his service to South Bend and providing a
world class symphony for such a long time. 

Councilmember Karen L. White thanked Mr. Yeh for sharing his gifts and passion with our
community and especially with South Bend' s youth. She also thanked his family for allowing
him to dedicate his life' s work to South Bend. It is wonderful we have greatness right here in
South Bend. 

Council President Tim Scott stated he could repeat everything this Council has said and thanked
him for all his work. He stated when he lived in St. Louis, Mr. Yeh was phenomenal there as
well. This world needs more beautiful music and more creativity and it is definitely needed
within our school system. 

Councilmember Dr. David Varner stated he was going to read My Symphony as well as a tribute. 
What is sometimes overlooked are these great things that happen just under the surface in South
Bend. Too often the things that make the news are things that make us frustrated and
disappointed. Councilmember Dr. Varner stated he remembers when Mr. Yeh came here and
how far the symphony has come in that tenure. It is definitely something the City can be proud of

and cherish.

which carried by a voice vote of eight (8)  ayes. 

Councilmember Karen White, Chair of the Personnel and Finance Committee,  reported that the
committee met and sends all three ( 3)  of these bills to the full Council with a favorable

recommendation. 

John Murphy, City Controller with offices on the 12th Floor of the County -City building, served
as both the presenter and petitioner of these three ( 3)  bills. These are the second quarter budget
transfers.  The first bill relates to additional appropriations for the enterprise funds. The second
bill is the budget transfers. These are just transfers from different accounts and not additional

REGULAR MEETING

appropriations. The third bill is the civil city funds appropriations.  The General Assembly passed
a special LOIT distribution which stipulated a special account should be set up and there will be
more discussion during the budget hearings on how to use those funds and the Council will have
ample opportunities to be a part of that discussion. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis asked Mr. Murphy to clarify the understanding related to the newly
established fund and how that will be appropriated. 

Mr. Murphy responded this fund is subject to appropriation by the Common Council. As far as
the 2017 budget process,  we want to have a good discussion on how these funds will be used just
like we do for all other funds. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis asked Mr. Murphy to explain to the public where this money has
come from. 

Mr. Murphy responded that the state holds local income tax money and distributes it to the
County and then the County distributes those funds to the City. The state had surplus funds they
were holding for all municipalities and they made a decision to distribute that LOIT money out
to the municipalities. For St. Joseph County it was around $4.2 million dollars of which all the
local entities received a proportional portion. The money was technically ours all along but held
in a trust account with the state. The funds are earmarked that 75%  of the money needs to go to
road projects and that it had to go into a certain fund with a number of two hundred and fifty - 
seven (257)  which we have set up. Any street type project would be eligible for money from this
fund. 

Councilmember Jo M. Broden asked if the $ 450, 000 allocated for Ironwood and Corby is for

engineering or something else. 

Mr. Murphy stated he doesn' t know the specifics but it may be leveraging federal match dollars. 

Councilmember Broden asked if there was any stipulation of when these funds need to be
dispersed. 

Mr. Murphy stated there is no timeline. The only stipulation is 75%  of the money needs to go to

road projects. 

No one from the public spoke either in favor of or in opposition to the three ( 3)  bills. 

Councilmember Oliver Davis made a motion to send Bill 32 -16 to the full Council with a
favorable recommendation. Councilmember Regina Williams- Preston seconded the motion
which carried by a voice vote of eight (8)  ayes. 

Councilmember Tim Scott made a motion to send Bill 33 -16 to the full Council with a favorable
recommendation.  Councilmember Karen White seconded the motion which carried by a voice
vote of eight ( 8)  ayes. 

Councilmember Tim Scott made a motion to send Bill 34 -16 to the full Council with a favorable
recommendation. Councilmember Oliver Davis seconded the motion which carried by a voice

REGULAR MEETING

JULY 11,  2016

NEW BUSINESS

Councilmember Oliver Davis commended the South Bend Police for handling this past weekend
very well and keeping us very safe. The officers are certainly in our prayers and we all are
striving for peace. 

Council President Tim Scott commended the citizens of South Bend on having proper respectful
discourse over the past few days and keeping South Bend out of the national news. Hopefully out
of all the tragedies experienced the past few weeks we can build upon the dialogue which took

place this weekend. 

PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR

Samuel Brown, 222 East Navarre Street South Bend, thanked Councilmember Regina Williams - 
Preston for getting an event he had on the Board of Public Works agenda. That is the definition
of good public service and responding to the resident' s needs. We were able to divert the side
street to make the event better. Mr. Brown also commended the police force for their outstanding
work. They were very kind and very polite. We had a lot of people from out of town at the event
and South Bend put a good effort forward. The community as a whole can come together if we
all work together like we did for this event. We want our officers to be safe and respectful and
we want our residents to conduct ourselves in a fine manner. 

Jesse Davis, P. O.  Box 10205 South Bend IN, stated he has heard of a lot of problems at Brothers
Bar at Eddy Street Commons. He stated there were two ( 2)  serious incidents his son reported to
him that happened over this past weekend. One ( 1) 
Dame football player who supposedly had an altercation with South Bend Police officers. Mr. 
Davis stated Michael Floyd tweeted out some negative things about the police officers and their
interactions with him. Also, Mr. Davis claimed there is video of the police taking down another
gentleman who then hit his head and it caused an incident. Mr. Davis asked how the nuisance
ordinance works because it would seem Brothers should be on that list. He also questioned why
the police officers are there if they are there on the clock. If they are working at a bar and being
paid to be there they are not representing South Bend. 

involved Michael Floyd who was a Notre

Jasmine Brown, 230 Sage Street,  stated she is a proud citizen of South Bend and the Westside. 
Ms. Brown expressed her pride of South Bend but has seen divisiveness on political and social
issues especially related to recent national events.  Although our police - community interactions
have improved they can still be better and best practices can still be found. Ms. Brown stated she
has noticed blight in our neighborhoods that needs to be addressed. There are many unresolved
issues regarding the police in South Bend and we have been blessed that some of these tensions
have not exploded into something worse. We need proactivity with our city leaders and an
increase in engagement.  She stated she will continue to work with the youth in South Bend and
follow as the Police Chief asked and address police officers with respect. She asked the city
leaders of South Bend to come out into the community and help address these divides. We need
not just equality but also equity. 

Ruth Warren,  1520 Sunnymede South Bend,  spoke in opposition to the proposed fire station in
Potawatomi Park. She expressed her respect for the Fire Department and their commitment to
South Bend but has many questions regarding this park. She asked what the decision making
process is for this station, how the stipulations in the deed for the park relate to the creation of
the fire station, how the station will be financed and what will the amount of the bond be, by
what criteria was this spot chosen for the new station, what are the indicators and metrics of
public safety and how would this proposed station increase that safety, what are the statistics and
data behind the calls that Station Nine (9)  currently receives,  and what does the data show about
the number and type of calls for all South Bend stations. Perhaps the river rescue is in the current
correct position right now and Station Nine ( 9)  could be expanded.
