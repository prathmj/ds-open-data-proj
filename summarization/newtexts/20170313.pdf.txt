Those from the public wishing to speak in favor of this bill: 

Samuel Brown, 222 East Navarre Street,  South Bend, IN, stated 1,  o the members of the St. Joseph
High School Indians that they had accomplished something very unique, and that they could not
yet understand the scope of this accomplishment at present. Mr. Brown stated that their pictures
would be hung up in their school, and that eventually their children would see those pictures. He
recounted a humorous anecdote of when his grandchild, in disbe ' ef, got to see Mr. Brown' s
picture in his school. He concluded by congratulating the ladies. 

Susan Richter,  1715 Hass Drive, South Bend, IN, stated that she remembers watching Ms. 
Smallbone play and win in 2005.  Ms. Richter continued, To wat 
this coach and then watch this
team win it in 2017 is a special memory that I' ll have for the rest of my life, and I certainly agree
with the gentleman: this is an honor that you will have for the rest of your life. On behalf of St. 
Joseph High School, I just want to say congratulations on a job ell done, and we are so proud
of our Lady Indians. 

None from the public wished to speak in opposition to this bill. 

Councilmember Regina Williams- Preston stated, I just want to s y congratulations. You have
accomplished an amazing feat and you deserve everything.

Councilmember Oliver Davis stated, I like what your coaches have done.  They have set the

now: you have won, now you' ve got to go out, later on in life, and teach some other young lady
how to win, too. That would be my encouragement to you, tonight.

MARCH 13,  2017

Councilmember Tim Scott stated,  I played basketball in Missouri and...  didn' t quite get there. 
The thing that you have got to remember is setting that bar high, and you guys achieved it. You
can use that all through life. Always remember that— what it takes to accomplish that. Thank
everybody around you, thank all the support that you guys have received. As long as the City of
South Bend is incorporated, you guys will be in the history books, as Mrs. Broden said earlier. 
Thank you for all you do. I remember when I played, and Randy is absolutely right: there are a
lot of little people out there that think you guys are the superstars that you really are. Don' t
forget that. Be kind to them and show them the way, too.

AMENDED TO EXPAND THE BOUNDARIES

OF THE EXISTING RIVERFRONT
DEVELOPMENT PROJECT AREA UNDER IND. 
CODE 7. 1-  3 -20 -16

Councilmember Regina Williams- Preston,  Vice -Chair of the Community Investment Committee, 
reported that they met this afternoon and send this bill forward with a favorable

recommendation. 

Jacob Alexander, the Department of Community Investment, with offices on the 14th Floor of the
County -City Building, South Bend, IN, introduced his co- presenter. 

Jill Scicchitano,  Executive Director of Downtown South Bend, 217 South Michigan Street, 
South Bend, IN, stated,  Downtown South Bend has been the administrator of the Riverfront
liquor license project for the past five ( 5)  years.  In June,  2012,  the Common Council adopted
South Bend boundaries establishing the Riverfront District, basically taking advantage of some
State legislation to make that possible. One ( 1)  of the things about the Riverfront District is that
it is exempt from the State alcohol and beverage permits quota, meaning in the Riverfront
District there is no restriction as to the number of permits that can be issued through this
program. This allows for new restaurants located within the boundaries to apply for a Riverfront
license,  also known as the " three ( 3) - way liquor license."  Currently in the State of Indiana, there
are twenty -two (22)  municipalities that have a Riverfront District, and, overall, one - hundred and
thirty ( 130)  active licenses are present throughout the State of Indiana. Ms. Scicchitano presented
to the Council and public a map of the district. She stated,  If we look at the existing project area, 

REGULAR MEETING

MARCH 13. 2017

this map here highlights the Riverfront District as it exists curreri today. The yellow
highlighted area illustrates those properties that are currently eligible for a three ( 3) - way license. 
These licenses are $ 1, 000. That is an annual fee primarily established to spur up a lot of
development along the Riverfront. If an applicant is interested in applying for this type of
license, the focus on the operation must be one ( 1)  that emphasizes a dining entertainment and
cultural arts experience,  and not an alcohol - consumption experience. 

Ms.  Scicchitano stated,  Some of the factors that are evaluated: beverages must be served in a
glass container, food must be consumed at a countertop or a table; it' s not a smoking
establishment, and it' s certainly one that does not emphasize private clubs,  adult entertainment
venues,  or night clubs. Currently in the Riverfront District, since the program originated in 2012, 
sixteen ( 16)  establishments have received permits. We anticipate,  throughout the next couple of
years, that number growing. There are thirteen ( 13)  active licenses right now in South Bend. If
we look at the expansion area and factors that determine new, eligible properties, you can see
those highlighted in red. We are able to really bring this opportunity forward for expansion. 
There was a reorganization and realignment of TIF boundaries i 2014,  so we' re able to kind of
look at the current district and take advantage of some of the areas that we can, because of two
2)  primary factors that dictate a Riverfront District: you have to be 1, 500 feet from the St. 
Joseph River, and it has to be within one ( 1)  of those TIF districts.  We have seen a lot of interest
in the area, primarily along the east of the Riverfront. You can see that' s where the majority of
some of the red lies. We have listed for you just some of those businesses and development that
people have expressed interest in. Some of that newer business - 70ne ( 1)  of them would be
existing businesses. Also, there' s been some activity: an increase from the business quarter along
Jefferson Boulevard. DTSB, as the program facilitator, does manage the process.  There is a
Riverfront license review committee that consists of five (5)  me bers:  there is a representative
from the Council, from the Redevelopment Commission, from t Department of Community
Investment, DTSB,  and the Mayor' s Office. This committee will meet, as needed, when

applications are received. What the committee will do is look at ffie application materials.  There
will be a public meeting where they address the application. There is also a State application. 
There are some evaluation criteria that the review committee does go through. I did provide a
graph so you can seethe trend of liquor license permitting in South Bend since the program was
initiated in 2012.  We anticipate three ( 3)  applications in the current district this year, and an
additional three ( 3)  would be an expansion. 

This being the time heretofore set for the Public Hearing on the a ove bill, proponents and
opponents were given an opportunity to be heard. 

Those from the public wishing to speak in favor of this bill: 

Brad Emberton, 727 South Eddy Street,  South Bend,  IN, stated,  his is the right idea at the right
time. Mr. Emberton stated that the proposal is about more than
key to economic development.

BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS FOR THE
PROPERTY LOCATED AT 1411 CARROLL
STREET, LOTS 82,  83,  84,  HANEY' S ADDITION

Councilmember Oliver Davis, Chair of the Zoning and Annexation Committee, reported that
they met this afternoon and send this bill forward with a favorable recommendation. 

Ayoka Paek, Zoning and Business Services Administrator with the Building Department,  125
South Lafayette Boulevard,  Suite 100,  South Bend,  IN, served as the presenter of this bill. Ms. 
Paek stated, This special exception for an accessory parking on properties zoned SF2,  Single - 
Family and Two (2)  Family District, comes to you with a favorable recommendation from the
Area Board of Zoning Appeals. It was initiated by a sign permit application that our department
was unable to approve due to the configuration of the owner' s properties.  The owner attempted
to vacate the alley between his alley and the parking lot, which would have removed the need for
special exception, but was unsuccessful. A variance was approved also for the height and size of
the sign on the property, pending approval of this special exception. No one spoke in
remonstrance at the ABZA meeting. 

John Miller, 19636 Glendale Avenue,  South Bend,  IN, served as the petitioner of this bill. Mr. 
Miller explained that the members of Gloria Dei Lutheran Church use the parking lot in question. 
He stated,  So,  it became incumbent upon us to have some sign recognition on that. There were
missteps, and I stubbed my toe several times, but thanks to the direction of the Building
Department, the Area Plan Commission, the Area Board of Zoning Appeals, and most certainly
our District Councilmember, Mr. Kelly, we are here.  This sign will tell our neighbors and our
friends that we are in the southeast side neighborhood to stay. 

This being the time heretofore set for the Public Hearing on the above bill, proponents and
opponents were given an opportunity to be heard. 

None from the public wished to speak in favor of or in opposition to this bill.

Jacob Alexander, the Department of Community Investment, wit offices on the 14th Floor of the

Hibberd Development, LLC is requesting a real property tax aba ment. They are looking to
invest a little over $5, 000, 000 into an abandoned downtown building to be converted into a
Mixed -Use development containing office, retail, and residential lispaces,  including a street level
green space and rooftop amenity, both of which are open to the public. Once the abatement is
completed, the project will generate roughly $95, 000 in annual tax revenue. 

Mark Neal,  1329 East Washington Street,  South Bend, IN, served as the petitioner of this bill. 
Mr. Neal stated, What has been reported today is a $ 3, 000, 000 investment, which was the
original amount we expected. The amount, as you noted, in the abatement application has now
been increased to over $5, 000, 000. It' s a significant project at a s gnificant cost. We are
extremely excited about the building and what it will mean in ten as of a link, as we extend our
downtown to the south and continue to provide, hopefully, opportunities for living, working, and
enjoying here in South Bend.

Councilmember Oliver Davis asked, 

What' s the ti eframe to fin sh all of that? 

REGULAR MEETING

MARCH 13,  2017

Mr. Neal responded, We expect to be going out to bid in April and May. We hope to have those
decided by May and begin construction in June. Actually, demolition first, and then construction. 
We have to kind of undo most of the building before we redo it. We expect to be done in eight
8)  to ten ( 10)  months. So,  we are desperately hoping to be ready for the first pitch of the
baseball season in 2018.  That will not include the parking spaces.  We' ll be working through that, 
given that Gates still has a lease to stay until June,  2019.  We will make that green space parking
but also green space,  during a part of Phase I. 

Councilmember Jo M. Broden asked, Your rooftop amenity —how are you accomplishing that, 
and what size will that be? 

Mr. Neal responded, So, the rooftop amenity, given both the seismic zone that we' re in and the
nature of the building that' s constructed,  as well as the cost regarding ingress and egress —we' ll
actually be limiting the amenity to a maximum capacity of forty -nine (49)  people.  It will be a
little over seven - hundred and fifty (750)  square feet. It will be a mostly open rooftop. There will
be a small storage area, a bathroom, an elevator and stairs that will go up to it. It will probably
have a fireplace and some comfortable chairs, but it will be something that provides views of the
City. 

Councilmember Broden asked, And access is what? 24/ 7?  How do you configure that? 

Mr. Neal responded,  The access will not be 24/ 7.  We need to work out how we will work with
both of our tenants —which will be office and retail tenants as well as our residential tenants —as
to the use of the space.  Clearly, we need to have a reasonable level of security and public safety. 
It is not intended to be an open party room, I can assure you of that, but it is supposed to be an
amenity for everyone in the building and those there during the public hours of the building. 

This being the time heretofore set for the Public Hearing on the above bill, proponents and
opponents were given an opportunity to be heard. 

None from the public wished to speak in favor of or in opposition to this bill.

Samuel Brown, 222 East Navarre Street,  South Bend, IN, addressed Councilmember Regina
Williams- Preston and Tim Scott, stating that something needs to be done about a disturbed
individual whom he has spoken to the Council about for two (2)  years.  Mr. Brown stated that the
man scares people and then those people call the Police on him, the Police are then sent to the
scene but then state that nothing can be done,  and the individual is returned to the streets without
the medication he most likely needs. He stated,  It' s over, it' s done.  It' s up to you guys, now. We
come to you when something is bothering us in our neighborhoods and our City. Mr. Scott, Ms. 
Preston, you cannot overlook this. I' m begging you. Please,  check into this. Get some help for
this individual, because, if you don' t, there' s going to be a life lost in the City of South Bend. 

Jesse Davis, P. O.  Box 10205,  South Bend,  IN, asked if the Council could check on whether or
not there has been progress on the Mayor' s group working on the homeless problem in South

Bend. He stated that the Weather Amnesty building is slated to c1 se on April 1St,  2017, which
would mean that thirty -five (35)  people who are currently sleepir g in the building will be out on
the streets after April 1St if there is not some alternative measure et in place for them. 

Bob Richthammer, 712 North Niles Avenue,  South Bend,  IN, stated that he wanted to voice his
opposition to the relocation of the ADP substation from Colfax Avenue to Niles Avenue. Mr. 
Richthammer stated that he received no guarantee from ADP that the relocation of the substation
to just beside his business would not interfere with his business operations.  He thanked the two
2)  Councilmembers that have been present at meetings held by home and business owners of the
City, though lamented the fact that no other City officials have been present. He stated, The
reason we would like them to show up is because there are a lot of gray areas.  We have been told
conflicting information as far as what' s going on,  and we would just like to know who is in
charge,  because we were informed of this decision in late February, but, according to some of the
research that some of the homeowners have done,  this was discussed as far back as December of
last year. Mr. Richthammer contended that home and business owners potentially most affected
by this decision should be included in the discussion.

David Francisco,  18425 Tulla Court, South Bend, IN,  stated that he also stands in opposition to
the relocation of the ADP substation. Mr. Francisco stated, What you will do if you allow ADP
to relocate to the Niles Avenue address is that you will kill off what is blossoming into a very
spectacular thing on Hill Street. You have people who are buying homes,  you have people who
are building homes, you have people who have stayed in their ho'  es for close to fifty (50)  years. 
That is the type of stability that you want as a Common Council   your neighborhoods. Mr. 
Francisco urged members of the Council to attend the homeowners'  meetings and to " reward the
people that have the courage to put their money where your mouth was with this vision." 

Donald Braizer, 743 North Elmer Street,  South Bend, IN, stated that he lives in the north side of
South Bend, in the Kennedy Primary Academy area. Mr. Braizer explained that the area is
deteriorating, and that the alleys in his neighborhood are in a bad state. He stated that the
residents of the neighborhood would appreciate if these alleys could be inspected and possibly
paved by the City. He stated, Kennedy School is well kept -up. They have torn down most of the
sore -eye houses in the neighborhood. Those of us that are still st ding would really appreciate it
if you would come over here and at least take care of that part of

it so we can continue living

there.
